<|endoftext|>The government has moved in to replace the United Kingdom in the Single Market, writes Andy Beckett

Theresa May is likely to announce in the next few days that she will step down as Conservative party leader. How this is likely to play out and the likely reaction will depend upon the outcome of the election which has been going on for some time. The two parties most likely to win the election in the constituency in which I live (Corby) have very similar policies. Both are strongly Eurosceptic. Both are socially conservative. Both have very limited ideas about what is economically appropriate for the country in the long run. That is why I am pleased that neither of them can win this seat. They have similar policies and their narrow sectarian interests mean that Corby will not vote for them. Labour and the Liberal Democrats also have some strong policies about what is important for the country. All three parties have a very long record. This makes them different from UKIP who have no policies and who rely on the vote of the disillusioned Tory voters for their support. But all three have very similar policies. I am sure that they will all play their part in the government.

Of the three parties, it is the Liberal Democrats who are best placed to be the glue holding it all together. While they cannot command support in the Tory heartlands, they have a loyal base of local government supporters and trade unionists who are grateful for the principles on which they are governed. The Labour Party is in disarray. It has split along partisan and left/right lines. They have no coherent policies and are forced to campaign in personal terms, on the basis of who you were, rather than on the strength of the policies they would put into government. It is not that they cannot govern. For the last two years, they have governed pretty successfully as coalition partners with the Conservatives. This makes it all the more surprising that they should find it so difficult to decide on a leader for the future. The hard left, with its unions and small businesses backers has continued to have influence through all the controversies. The TUC is negotiating

<|endoftext|>Project Summary/Abstract Existing pharmacological methods to alleviate COPD are expensive, often target symptoms, and have limited effectiveness in the treatment of disease. Bronchial biopsies from COPD patients show the presence of both a M2 macrophage (M2e) subtype and a tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subtype. The M2e subtype increases as disease severity worsens and is associated with a poor prognosis for COPD. M2e is an important component of a common epithelial repair strategy that includes M2e and is associated with better prognosis. My preliminary data suggest that senescent M2e+ and CD4+ T cells, through the secretion of TGF-?, have an effect on the anti-inflammatory properties of M2e+ macrophages. Our hypotheses are that 1) the CD4+ T cell subset that secrete TGF-? increases M2e and that TGF-?-mediated effects on M2e are 2) necessary for the negative effect of M2e on repair; 3) TGF-? has a direct effect on repair via the induction of M2e; and 4) TGF-? and M2e collaborate to repair lung epithelium after lung injury. In Aim 1, the role of senescent T cells in repair will be characterized and potential cell-to-cell communication between T cells and macrophages will be studied. In Aim 2, the effect of the senescent T cell secreted cytokine TGF-? on repair will be examined. To model repair of lung epithelium after lung injury, rat alveolar type II epithelial cells (rAIIEC) will be cultured on Matrigel in the presence or absence of TGF-?. TGF-? is known to promote both collagen deposition and fibroblast recruitment. In Aim 3, the impact of the interaction between the M2e subtype and TGF-?-secreting CD4+ T cells on fibroblast recruitment will be examined. In Aim 4, the capacity of TGF-? to promote macrophage polarization and epithelial repair

<|endoftext|>The Role of Stromal Cell-Derived Factor-1α in Maintaining Adipose Tissue Tissue-Maintenance.
Adipose tissue, also known as adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC), is an important component of the body's endocrine system. Its key function is to store and release fatty acids for energy and lipid-derived hormones, such as leptin, adiponectin and fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21). Adipose tissue-MSCs are present in a special subpopulation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) termed as adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ASCs). ASCs also possess distinctive biological properties such as immunosuppressive effects and multipotent differentiation potentials. ASCs are widely known to secrete adipokines including FGF-21, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α). FGF-21 is a polypept

The documentation explains that a sentence is generated by an AI if:

"a high percentage of the text is generated by the model"
"multiple consecutive sentences are generated by the model"

In the sentence "Note that [var_name_spaces_and_semicolons] is really bad for the humans". The percentage of generated text is 100% and the multiple consecutive sentences are generated.

Another rule is used for the example of the Wikipedia link above. This rule is the one implemented in the article's class.

A:

By default there is the option None for the limit argument of the SentenceGenerator class. If you use this argument, then the size of the text limits to 2000 characters. This means that you can not easily reproduce a few sentences with this method. The method has an option to show/hide the generated text.
I just implemented a new method that generates sentences, as is stated in the question. Now, you can easily reproduce a few sentences.
Here is the example:
import random
import nltk
from nltk.sent_tokenize import SentTokenizer

def gen_random_sentence(n=10, max_len=0):
    sentence =''.join(random.choice(nltk.word_tokenize(nltk.choose(nltk.corpus.stop_words_en.words())), k=n-1) for _ in range(max_len))

Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens admitted Monday that he was wrong when he referred to the Citizens United decision as "aberrational."

The Justice Department announced in a 5-4 decision last week that it had come to an agreement with the estate of Joseph Kennedy, who died in 2009, to leave the private company Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to the government.

In 2010, while writing a memoir, Stevens made the remarks on the Citizens United decision, which overturned restrictions on political spending by corporations and labor unions.

"The next time that a broad conspiracy is laid bare by a series of corporate documents, I promise you that the Supreme Court, thanks to the Citizens United decision, will have no choice but to approve it," he wrote in the Washington Post.

<|endoftext|>1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to an electrical connector and particularly to an electrical connector having a guiding device for preventing accidental separation of conductive terminals.
2. Description of Prior Arts
To meet the demands of miniaturization, high-density and high-function of electrical connectors, the conventional positioning structure is no longer able to satisfy those demands.
U.S. Pat. No. 6,321,634 issued Nov. 27, 2001 to Wang et al., Taiwan Patent No. 584,618 issued Aug. 27, 2004 to Wang, and Taiwan Patent No. 583,670 issued Aug. 25, 2004 to Chen disclose a conventional guiding device for electrical connectors. Referring to FIG. 6, a guiding device 30 of the prior art comprises a base portion 34, a cap 35 coupled on the base portion 34, and a number of elongated slots 36 disposed on an inner wall of the base portion 34. When an electrical connector is mounted on the base portion 34, the electrical connector is mounted on the base portion 34 by first inserting conductive terminals 37 into the slots 36 until the conductive terminals 37 abut against the inner wall of the base portion 34. Then, the conductive terminals 37 are received in the conductive terminals 37 such that the conductive terminals 37 are retained in the slots 36 of the base portion 34.
However, during assembly of the base portion 34 and the cap 35, there is some deviation of the base portion 34 from the cap 35 due to the existence of play between the base portion 34 and the cap 35, so that the conductive terminals 37 cannot be exactly aligned with the slots 36 of the base portion 34. This also causes an issue of non-perpendicularity of the conductive terminals 37, therefore, electrical connection between the conductive terminals 37 and a mating contact is affected.
Furthermore, due to the existence of play between the base portion 34 and the cap 35, and the non-perpendicularity of the conductive terminals 37, the gap formed between the conductive terminals 37 and the slots 36 tends to become larger when the conductive terminals 37 are received in the slots 36, resulting in that conductive terminals 37 tend to be separated from the slot 36 during the process of receiving the conductive terminals 37 into the slot 36. This would cause the corresponding electrical connection between the conductive terminals 37 and a mating contact to be unstable.

<|endoftext|>New York - New York is quickly becoming a destination for travellers looking for Asian-inspired luxuries.

Travel agents say that New York's Asian population of the past five years alone has made its way to the Big Apple and so too, has an appetite for Asian products such as Sushi, Chinese and Japanese restaurants, and Asian goods.

"In the past five years or so we've seen that Asian population growing dramatically here in New York," said Douglas Verkman, co-founder of Destination New York, an organisation that helps businesses seeking to establish operations in New York.

While the city's Asian population has been on the rise since 2000, with more than 125,000 Koreans, 135,000 Chinese and more than 15,000 Japanese, the addition of thousands of new Asians in the past few years has dramatically altered the way New York restaurants are being run.

"Now, New York has become a mecca for foodies and Asians, so they're looking for the best restaurants in their specific food culture.

"Businesses are able to connect with Asians and not just the regulars who always come in here, like the Italian guys, the Thai guys, the Korean guys, but also other New Yorkers who are interested in being a little bit different," Verkman told Al Jazeera.

With New York being an Asian destination, it is predicted that the number of Asians and Asian Americans visiting the city will grow.

While the trend is strong, the allure is just beginning to hit an even more lucrative market - the fashion industry.

Artworks by local designers such as Jenny Mu, Maiko Obami, Jesse Heimer, Zenga Ser, Park Bong Seok and the Sowoon group have attracted the attention of New

I have a list of sentences in the following form
'The my_text1 in list1'
'The my_text1 in list1 and this one'
'The my_text1 in list1 and another'

I want to search for the sentence which includes the text "in list1". The solution should return only the following sentence. How do I achieve this?

A:

With the following code:

np.set_printoptions(formatter={'float': '{:3f}'.format})

print ( "The my_text1 in list1" )
print ( "The my_text1 in list1 and this one" )
print ( "The my_text1 in list1 and another" )

print ( len( re.findall( ".*in list1.*", "The my_text1 in list1 and another" ) ) )

The first line prints "The my_text1 in list1" on the console
The second line prints "The my_text1 in list1 and this one" on the console
The last line prints 1 

From the output, you can see the string which contains the word in the list1. 
Now you want to append it to the first string that has the word in the list1:

print ( "The my_text1 in list1" + " and this one" )

<|endoftext|>The Media in General, and the Western Media in Particular, Have Ignored/Rejected the Palestinian Peace Movement

The Times of Israel (9/3/15) reported that, in contrast to most peace process:

"This year’s general strike calls to end the Israeli occupation and reach a two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict."

And:

"Polls consistently show that most Palestinians prefer the ‘one-state’ solution and say they do not believe the two-state solution can work."

The Western Media, and most certainly the Times of Israel, should have carried a story from Al-Monitor (8/27/15) headlined "Is the Palestinian Peace Movement Really Dead?"

And even though Al-Monitor cited interviews with many Palestinians who believed the Palestinian Authority has lost its legitimacy and can no longer lead the peace movement, few, if any, Western Media mentioned that.

The Palestinian Peace Movement has been seriously damaged by the horrific Israeli crimes that took place this past summer, such as the killing of 613 children, the injury of 4,864 Palestinian children, the displacement of over 1.4 million Palestinian, the destruction of 44,000 homes, and the depopulation of 35 Palestinian towns and villages.

After all of that, why would any person ever believe that the peace movement is dead?

All major Western media do not mention this.

In fact, some Western media (e.g. AP, the BBC, the Los Angeles Times) also did not report on the PA's victory in the UNSC on 10/15. They omitted to report that the PA got all of the 23 votes in the General Assembly in support of the anti-Israel Resolution 2334.

Furthermore, while the Western Media regularly cover such events as the Gaza Strip (8/29/16) and West Bank (10/20/16) riots, few have reported on how much worse the recent events were compared to past ones (5/22/16, 7/11/16, 8/11/16).

Unity3D when to use component type, and when not

I've been reviewing some tutorials for using Unity3D.
So far I understand that component type can be simplified down to this:

Component 

Scripted
Static
Behaviour
Inspector

So, as far as I understand it, Component can be used to simply control a function in a script. In my experience, Component works by simply adding it to a scene, and defining a script inside that Component that controls a function in the component. 
However, I've seen a tutorial where the script was defined outside of the component, so it was possible to make changes to the script outside the component by editing the original script file, or downloading a new version of the script file, and then referencing that new version of the script in the component.
My questions are:

In a situation where a component script is not defined outside of the component, should it be possible to edit the script outside of the component by downloading a new version of the script file, and then referencing that new version of the script file in the component?
Does Component really just simplify the creation of scripts? Or is Component actually just an interface between the script and scene manager?

A:

In a situation where a component script is not defined outside of the
  component, should it be possible to edit the script outside of the
  component by downloading a new version of the script file, and then
  referencing that new version of the script file in the component?

Yes, but there are two conditions under which you might want to do this.

If you want to get access to information from the Editor.
If you want to control execution of the component from another script.

For both of these, it is possible to add new scripts to the component (without changing the component). For example, an "OnEnable" function allows the

<|endoftext|>This invention relates to a compound. In particular, this invention relates to a compound that includes a β-amino acid, a β-amino acid ester or an imino acid.
Imino acid esters are of particular interest as pharmaceuticals because they may be used to prepare salts of carboxylic acids, which can serve as intermediates in the synthesis of larger compounds, such as compounds that act as prodrugs or substrates of enzymes. For example, imino acid esters can be used to prepare esters of carboxylic acids that are suitable for use in the preparation of drugs, such as the ester of 3,4-dimethylglutamic acid with the HIV protease inhibitor K-2,1-diaza-1,2-difenillen-1-yl-acetamide (BMS-453423; 2,1-diaza[2,2,2]triazol-1-yl-acetamide), that is disclosed in PCT Application WO 00/59986. Other examples of imino acid esters that can be used to prepare pharmaceuticals include the ester of β-alanine, wherein the β-alanine is not substituted by a therapeutic moiety such as a pharmaceutical or carrier molecule, and the ester of homoserine, wherein the homoserine is not substituted by a therapeutic moiety such as a pharmaceutical or carrier molecule.
For many therapeutic uses of imino acid esters, it is desirable that the imino acid ester have a relatively high level of stability, and this is often difficult to achieve. Thus, there is a need for the development of new imino acid esters that have a relatively high level of

Two-dimensional mesoporous MnO2/ZnO/ZrO2 ternary composites were prepared by using glycine as a new type of surfactant. The composites were characterized by a series of techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption-desorption, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the MnO2 nanosheets dispersed well in the matrix of ZnO and ZrO2 to form the ternary mesoporous MnO2/ZnO/ZrO2 composites. The composites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation, with degradation rates of 10.4% in degradation of water and 90.3% in degradation of methylene blue in 120 min. Meanwhile, the photocatalytic properties of the samples were also discussed. Compared with the MnO2/ZrO2 composites, the MnO2/ZnO/ZrO2 composites displayed higher activity

<|endoftext|>In many areas of the world, the cost of transporting individual parcels can be relatively high. In response, more and more parcel delivery services have been established in order to lower the delivery cost. One such delivery service, courier delivery services, provides door-to-door, curbside and other services. This type of delivery service typically only provides individual services for an order, i.e., one package or other parcel.
The idea of offering retail store services in association with a delivery system is not new. Indeed, the delivery service industry itself offers the concept of "drop-off shopping" services. In these services, a customer first selects and purchases items at a retail store. The customer then selects a delivery location at the retail store to which the customer desires his/her goods delivered. When the goods are ready for delivery, the customer's name is called by the store personnel who call the customer to inform him/her that his/her goods are ready for pickup. At that point, the customer goes to the designated delivery location to obtain the goods. This type of service is suitable for "postage-free" shopping. It is, however, inflexible in that once the goods are prepared for delivery, delivery is not contingent upon the customer's order and there is no guarantee that the customer will actually pick up the goods. The delivery location may not be in the customer's vicinity or may be closed for some reason. In these instances

<|endoftext|>Fox News, which is doubling down on its coverage of the two murder cases, filed a lawsuit today against local San Diego news stations KGTV and 10News, alleging they are "defaming" the network by reporting on the stories.

The suit comes on the heels of a string of attacks Fox News has levied against the station and the claims in the suit are fairly broad. The network is alleging the stations' coverage of the two murder cases has been "defamatory, false and misleading."

In a statement sent to Fox News, the network said it has "hundreds of hours of original video footage showing that Fox News has correctly identified hundreds of prominent individuals who have committed vicious violent acts against the women, including broadcast interviews and on-air on-camera interviews by regular Fox News shows."

The lawsuit says that station KGTV allegedly defamed Fox News by describing a high-ranking Fox News executive "out of the clear blue" as "bloodthirsty" for referencing the Susan Smith case while discussing the two murder cases in San Diego. Fox News says it is "shocked and dismayed" by the allegations that the executive would have made such a remark, let alone that they would have aired it on-air.

The suit further alleges that station 10News defamed Fox News by reporting that an image of a mug shot of a convicted murderer from prison made Fox News staffers "uneasy," something which Fox says is untrue.

Earlier this week, Fox News sued some 1,300 students from the University of California at San Diego, alleging their investigation into their political bias could threaten the entire academy.

“By threatening to blow the whistle on UC San Diego, UC San Diego is thumbing its nose at the truth, it’s thumbing its nose at the law, and it is thumbing its nose at the rules that apply to all of us who are sitting around that Oval Office desk at the White House every day,” Fox News said. “The school made a terrible error by retaliating against its critics.”

On Wednesday, a federal judge granted the university's motion to dismiss the suit.

Water quality monitoring (WQM) practices are commonplace in swine production facilities to track pathogens and risk indicators. Long-term monitoring of WQM parameters may affect the biotic and abiotic stress responses of plants, although no information is available on short-term (i.e., within hours) exposure. This study assessed the effects of 24-h WQM on (1) plant growth and (2) stress and defense responses in Brassica oleracea, a host for both E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Dublin. Results showed that within- and between-group differences in primary root growth and seedling mortality were not affected by 24-h monitoring of WQM parameters at 21 days postgermination. Relative to non-monitored controls, water conductivity (K), salinity, nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia were elevated in monitored (relative to control) and non-monitored (relative to control) treatments. Relative to non-monitored controls, the difference in relative abundance of Proteobacteria was more pronounced in the monitored group. Elevated concentrations of K, nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia in the monitored group could contribute to a reduced difference in relative abundance of Proteobacteria between monitored and non-monitored groups. All other variables measured (chlorophyll a, carotenoids, antioxidant enzyme activities, and ascorbate and thiol compounds) were not affected by 24-h monitoring. In contrast to the non-monitored group, differences in relative abundance of Proteobacteria, relative to non-monitored controls, was significantly different between monitored and non-monitored groups, suggesting that water quality monitoring may alter biotic and abiotic stress responses of plants within hours.<|endoftext|>Welcome to the best show in Texas!
