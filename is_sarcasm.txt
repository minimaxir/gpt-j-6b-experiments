<|endoftext|>Q:

Does any such things like katalizator exist?

I know it sounds trivial, but let me just clarify things first.
I am not talking about server farms, where several servers run a single database.
I am talking about super efficient servers, with multiple disks. With multiple CPUs.
With big servers, like IBM z series. 
I am thinking about a load balancing device, with several disks and a queue of commands, where command are placed. 
Command A -> Disk 1
Command B -> Disk 2
Command C -> Disk 3

And we need to balance multiple servers, and save all this commands in a queue.
Does such thing exist? If it does, how is it built? Is it designed using queue theory? Is it built using queues in RAMs?

A:

Super-efficient means using cheap RAM, and cheap CPU. Not specialized CPU with lots of cores.
So one idea would be a disk drive system which reads / writes entire data sets at once. Typical single level or linear hard disks can manage such operations in under 1 second. But disk drives come with some performance penalties (spinning a disk is not instantaneous).
Other approaches would be to multiplex

<|endoftext|>1. Technical Field
The present disclosure relates generally to electrosurgical devices used for open and endoscopic surgical procedures. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to end effectors of electrosurgical devices that employ high frequency power.
2. Background of Related Art
Electrosurgical devices are generally known in the art to comprise a handpiece and an end effector attached to the handpiece. The handpiece is electrically connected to a radio-frequency (RF) generator and the end effector is electrically connected to the RF generator as well. The RF generator provides electric energy to the electrosurgical device through a cable. Alternatively, the handpiece may be self-contained and contain its own supply of power to produce an RF electrosurgical output.
In use, the end effector is generally configured to interface with a surgical instrument and articulate the end effector so as to facilitate the removal of tissue and/or smoke evacuation through the end effector. The end effector may include a knife assembly that is configured to utilize high frequency electrical power. The end effector may comprise an active cutting tip, an electro-coagulator tip, and/or any other type of working surface that can be configured to resect, cut, coagulate, seal, or fulgurate tissue. When performing surgery, the end effector, knife assembly, and/or working surface can be configured to perform a cutting operation, a sealing operation, a cauterizing operation, a fulguration operation, or any combination thereof.
The end effector is typically attached to the handpiece at the distal end of a shaft, such that when the surgeon actuates the handpiece so as to rotate the shaft, the end effector rotates with the shaft, thereby articulating

Swapping multiple components with a change in orientation?

When dealing with components such as the PasswordField of the visual studio GUI designer I'm aware that as I re-orient the form things such as color and background fade and the name appears above the field as it should. 
However, if I attempt to swap two components (eg a PasswordField and a textbox) in this fashion I just get the 2 not lined up again. Is there a trick I am missing here? 

A:

Try removing the password field before moving the TextBox. Otherwise the text box will appear overtop of the password field. 

A:

You might want to first remove the existing component (as @Sorabh mentioned) to solve this.
A different approach to this would be to create a StackPanel and add the components in that. This way, when you rotate, it can be redrawn as a side-by-side design.

Now that we have the code, let's talk about how to use the code. We define a function, which will translate our string into an equivalent string using sarcasm.
def change_sarcasm(original_string):
    """Change a string into an equivalent using sarcasm"""
    converted_string = ""
    for char in original_string:
        if char == " " and is_sarcasm(original_string):
            converted_string += " ".join([SARCASM[x] for x in chr(ord(char) + 1)] +
                                         [SARCASM[ord(char)] + "X"])
        else:
            converted_string += SARCASM[ord(char)]
    return converted_string

This function will take a string and transform it to an equivalent using sarcasm. This function will either return the string, if it has not converted to sarcasm or a string containing the transformed string, if it has.
Now, you need to evaluate what this function actually does. Let's first write down the changes in the original string and the result string. If you do not change the original string, then the result string should look like this:
>>> original_string = "Saras the elephant is an idiot"
>>> converted_string = change_sarcasm(original_string)
>>> converted_string
"Saras the elephant is an idiotX"
>>> original_string
"Saras the elephant is an idiot"

And if you actually use our function, then the result should be:
>>> original_string = "Saras the elephant is an idiot"
>>> converted_string = change_sarcasm(original_string)
>>> converted_string
"Saras the elephant is an idiotX"
>>> original

<|endoftext|>Q:

Why is my cluster getting up to 85 degrees F on July 27th?

I just noticed that my cluster has slowly gotten up to 85 degrees F in just over a month. At first I didn't think much of it, but after a few days of being at 85 degrees F the cluster has begun getting hot as the day goes on. 
It's outside in a locked garage, but the garage gets heated naturally (heating is the same in all the apartments in the building). My main questions are:

Is there any possible way to help this situation? Is there something I can do to keep my cluster cooler?
Is it ok to leave my hives out to 85 degrees in a closed garage?

A:

I suspect your first step is to do a heat balance. You will need to use a hive body thermometer, as well as a dew/chiller scraper, and you might want to freeze something that comes into your house. Once you have a good idea of your heat gain, you can adjust the vents to minimize it. 
That said, you don't have to leave them in your garage or anything like that, they can be safely placed outside, especially if you can keep them shaded (like I do) or in a cooler location. 
I can't give you a definitive answer, but I can tell you from experience that (at the time of my writing, mid-2018) I also left a hive outside in open air, in my truck/trailer. The air temperature outside was in the low 80s F, and the hive was in the low 80s F (just high enough to warm the bees). The hive was doing fine, without the added heat/stress of being in a large, metal structure.

A:

The usage of index() instead of find() would improve performance dramatically.

The iteration over a set will be considerably faster than in a list.
If the sarcasm contains several, then it makes sense to split at comma.
In this case, I'd use an exclusion list.

The code may look like this:

<|endoftext|>One of the easiest and least expensive ways to learn a new language is by taking a language course at your local university. Universities are often willing to give you free access to their language programs, and you’ll often have the advantage of additional practice outside of class. Of course, you’re still limited to the local campus, which is not always practical for a group of people, but it can be a great place to get started if you’re more introverted and shy.

But if you want to learn a language from the ground up—not by spending endless hours taking classes, and not by doing that cold open-mike exchange at a bar in some foreign country—there are many language apps that will help you overcome those language learning barriers. These applications will help you pick up the language with or without a teacher—because in today’s world, everyone should know two languages. Here are our best picks for

<|endoftext|>Okay, but remember, just because you put a riddle in your mini-lab doesn't mean you need to actually solve it. If you do solve it, come back and share it with us. We'll be doing them at the end of the month and we'll be picking a winner, so good luck.

To solve the riddle, simply use the alphabet in your lab on page 98 (t is for these months).

You can use it with the word Puzzle, Puzzle - Step 1, but you must have that defined in your lab.

Thanks again for all your help and feedback!

Happy Monday!

In case you didn't know, tomorrow is TOMORROW - July 29th!

You'll find the first doodle for the week tomorrow morning at 10am on the Chegg platform. Can't wait to see what it is, but rest assured, it will be exciting.

Chegg has started a new project today called Cheggtastic. What do you think of the name? We've actually had a lot of requests for this type of thing and this is our first attempt at a start.

It will be a play-mat game where there are hundreds of questions to test your knowledge and doodle the answers. The questions are drawn from a community of math enthusiasts and will likely test your knowledge of graph theory, geometry, probability and all

This checks:

String length
Returns whether the string is long
Whether the string contains certain char

Note that this doesn't actually test whether the string contains sarcasm, just if it looks like it does. If your language is limited to ASCII strings, it's probably safe to just check the length of a string.

<|endoftext|>Q:

Can I automatically write down the answers to multiple choice problems on my exam?

I'm fairly certain I've seen this mentioned elsewhere on Stack Exchange, but I can't find any reference to it.
Suppose you have a multiple-choice problem on your exam:

Question 1: Some symbols are represented as $\circ$, $\sqrt{}$, $\sin(3)$
  and $\sqrt{\sin(3)}$
Question 2: $a,b,c$ are three positive numbers

In other words, it's a question consisting of two separate choices.
My answer to this question might well have a lot of symbols, and in fact my answer would likely be

<|endoftext|>Tarantulas find an arboreal nesting place for comfort and protection

Would you believe a tarantula can build its nest by drilling into tree bark? How about that, the tarantula is just one of many arboreal arthropods that use holes and ladders to get their food and get a look at the world.

Until recently, people regarded tree-dwelling invertebrates to be little more than flying squirrels, wood lice or the dreaded centipedes. But we now know that the oak tarantula has great skill in finding tree branches to build its long and rather large burrow. Tarantulas are by no means tree climbers, but rather they have a unique means of ascending and descending a tree that has taken a life of its own.

Here is my questions:

I tried to write the sentences in past tense instead of present tense and there is no influence on the results, so I think this is not a problem in the test data. 
I tested my code with the same test data and it is working, so I think the issue comes from the test framework. Any suggestions?
I tried some generic solvers like solver and sunspot but they all fail. What should I do? Is it possible to use the solvers provided by moses?
Any other useful information is appreciated.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(is_sarcasm('He can't be more awesome than me!'.split(' ')))

Here I used a regular expression to split on '!', but you could split on whatever character you want.

A:

First: If you wanted to use regular expressions, instead of splitting on '!', you would use.replace(), like this:
>>> import re
>>> s = 'He can\'t be more awesome than me!  \nWho is more awesome than me?!'
>>> re.findall(r"can't be more awesome than me\!", s)
['can't be more awesome than me!']
>>> re.findall(r"can\'t be more awesome than me\!", s)
['can\'t be more awesome than me!']

Second: Also, please remember to escape quotes in regular expressions when you use them in a string. That makes them easier to read. You already have a quotemeta method, which will do that.
Also, there is a huge difference between putting the! in a string and putting the string in a function.
In the first case, it is interpreted as part of a string literal, and is then not checked against the function's return values. If you wanted to use this string in a function, however, you would have to escape the! as well.
So, if you write
def is_sarcasm(s):
    return s.upper() in SARCASTIC_WORDS

and then do this:
if is_sarcasm('He can\'t be more awesome than me!'):
    print('It\'s a sarcastic string!')
else:
    print('It\'s not sarcastic!')

It will print out:
It's not sarcastic!

instead of
It's a sarcastic string!

You might have realized why this happens now, because when you run this line in your code:
if is_sarcasm('He can\'t be more awesome than me!'.split(' ')))

you are actually turning 'He can\'t be more awesome than me!'.split(' ') into a string and then using it in the if statement

If someone can help me fixing that I would be very thankful.

A:

The way you are returning values is causing the issue. When using multiple returns you have to be aware of the order.
If the order of execution is such that the value at the second call (with True) is returned before the first one (with False), then the check for the first argument will return False, thus breaking the loop and continuing executing the code below that (since the return is located there).

PHP: Replace non alphanumeric characters (UTF8) with HTML entities

I have a multilingual site and have some links that should be encoded as HTML entities. However, there are some UTF8 characters, e.g. eç, that would not be replaced correctly if I use the UTF8 flag. 
My solution for now is to preg_replace them:
$output = preg_replace("/[^\x00-\x7F]+/", htmlentities('UTF-8', ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF8'), $output);

Is there an easier way, maybe using some sort of filter?

A:

One way would be to use a regular expression replacement pattern:
$output = preg_replace("~[^\x00-\x7F]+~u

def is_sarcasm(s):
    """Check whether the string is sarcastic"""

s = "I had a great day today!"

# The third character before the! is the sarcastic one
if is_sarcasm(s):
    # s is sarcastic

A:

Is it safe to read into memory that it's sarcastic?

Well, you would probably be in trouble in some countries if you did.
That said, if you want to do this for text, all you need to do is use strip:
def is_sarcasm(s):
    return s.strip().endswith('!')

Demo:
>>> def is_sarcasm(s):
...     return s.strip().endswith('!')
... 
>>> is_sarcasm('I am a sarcastic! person')
True
>>> is_sarcasm('I am not a sarcastic! person')
False
>>> is_sarcasm('You are a sarcastic! person')
True

A:

According to this research in Cognitive Science
from the subsection entitled The German Negation:

In the last case, the core determinant of a negative assertion is the genitive case marker mit (or der, if the sentence is absolute), which, as in the above sentences, introduces a genitive demonstrative with which the act of negation is associated.
The -genitive is, then, a metalinguistic designation for a class of sentences in which the subject, S, is negated by reference to the predicate, P: i.e. the S with the formal predicate P is canceled. (p. 219).

More importantly, we can see in the section on Double Negation that (p. 223)

By double negation, the subject is canceled if it is already the predicate.

Thus, we can make the following assumptions
a) The subject is the subject's agent, S.
b) The subject is canceled if the agent is already the subject
Assumption b) is true when we do an example for sarcasm because

agent is S,

<|endoftext|>The title for this week's blog is based on a sentiment I frequently hear at work: "If it wasn't for work, I'd be homeless." That seems strange to me. I understand the sentiment, as our work is where we can be with people we don't otherwise get to know. Our work is who we are. For many, work is our sole or primary identity.

I know that for me, at least, work is very important to my identity. And yet, I don't know of anyone who's never felt "homeless." Even homeless people who've made it into their own apartment have a sense of homelessness: they feel a connection to the streets and to the people who can be found on the streets.

In a paper by Judith White and Seth Y. Mirsky, titled The Probability of Being Homeless: Evidence from a Survey of Seattle Workers, the researchers try to figure out why some people who've experienced homelessness experience this negative sense of "homelessness" so

<|endoftext|>It was actually the 1990s that the term was first applied. When famous British rockers Oasis were to hit it big, their weight made them into ‘a band of lads’. They needed to be labelled a female group, by the way. Girls can’t do that. There was always something of a macho overtones. They were ‘four dangerous boys’, in fact. Later, Lady Gaga made that term mainstream. She's all big hair and dramatic dress.<|endoftext|>Facial-nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity as a predictor of development of late asthma.
