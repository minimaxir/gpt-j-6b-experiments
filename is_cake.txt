<|endoftext|>Studies on the beta-turn in the association domain of plasminogen.
A beta-turn is formed in the association domain (amino acids 123-145) of plasminogen by water-mediated stacking of residues Lys-124 and Asp-125. The two residues bind to the molecules of other lysine-binding proteins. The experimental study supports the theoretical construction of the turn. Lysine, glycerol, and its derivatives, which bind to plasminogen, form an hydrogen bond network at the edge of the turn, stabilizing it. These investigations shed light on the role of water in binding of protein-ligand complexes.<|endoftext|>Reconstruction of reduced sacrectomy defects with a V-Y groin rotation flap in four dogs.
The V-Y groin flap has been reported to be useful for reconstructing large bony defects resulting from oncologic resection of musculoskeletal tumors and has been used for coverage of defects caused by malignant osteolysis or infection after bisphosphonate use. This study investigated the use of a V-Y groin flap as a tissue-engineered scaffold for the reconstruction of skeletal defects resulting from sacrectomy in 4 dogs. A circumferential skin incision was made at the ventral aspect of the thigh, centered on the midline of the proximal femur. A two-staged medial inguinal

    if get_seed_size(cake) == 1:
        return "True"
    else:
        return "False"

This then checks that if you take away all but one the rest are one.
From what you've said, you have 
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) 
(9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16)
(17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24)
(25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32)
(33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40)

To look like
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) 
(9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16)
(17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24)
(25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32)
(33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40)

First it makes all lists equal.  Then it moves all except one to be the first one.
Then it checks whether the list that is being used to make the lists from has no other than 1 in it.  Then it returns True if that list is only made of one number and False if it has more than one.  (Since the ones are always on the end of the list)
So if we have 9,17,25 and 1,13,27 it's
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) 
(9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16)
(17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24)
(25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32)

The length of the rest is 1 so it's false, but if you look at
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) 
(9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16)

def is_cake(cake):
    """Check whether the cake is true"""
    if cake == "true":
        return True
    else:
        return False

is_cake('true') == True
# Should be true

is_cake('false') == False
# Should be false

What I'm doing is something like an indirection, but instead of calling the function, it checks if the parameter is "true" or "false".

A:

You could write a decorator that checks and raises an exception if the function's argument is falsey:
def bool(f):
    def new_f(*args, **kwargs):
        if not is_cake(args[0]):
            raise ValueError('the first argument to bool must be truthy')
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    new_f.__doc__ = f.__doc__
    new_f.__name__ = f.__name__
    new_f.__module__ = f.__module__
    return new_f

This allows you to do what you want like this:
@bool
def some_function(x):
    if x:
        print('passed')
    else:
        print('failed')

and also like this:
def cake(x):
    return bool(x)

@cake
def some_function(x):
    if cake(x):
        print('passed')
    else:
        print('failed')

I'm not sure if you can do this in one line like you requested, but you could do something like this:
def cake(x):
    def n(*args, **kwargs):
        if not is_cake(args[0]):
            raise ValueError('the first argument to bool must be truthy')
        return bool(x)(*args, **kw

<|endoftext|>Synopsis

Most discussions about pornography and modern love focus on men’s use of it and our responses to it. These conversations have typically been about harm to women and girls, and men’s lack of agency, and questions about power and consent. However, the very presence of men, both active and passive, in sex roles within and outside of the pornography industry, often overlooks women’s agency.

Sex workers in the UK, the US, Europe, and beyond have long opposed attempts to criminalize their work or their clients, both inside and outside of sex work. While prostitution is often “simply a product of patriarchy,” as US feminist Laurie Penny has written, this can also be extended to pornography: sex work and porn can be seen as a “toolkit” and form of political action that allows women to reclaim not only sex, but gender.

This book, which is based on interviews with a number of women working in sex work and porn, explores how these women talk about porn and their experiences of it. It considers what it means to live as a sex worker and a porn performer, what the stigma of sex work is, and how it is a product of, and in turn, contributes to, gender.

The book also suggests ways that women involved in sex work can challenge, fight back, and create alternatives to porn in the present.

Pythons solution is valid but you can add functionality in an easier and less redundant manner. You can iterate over the itertools.product(x,y) and see if the product is the sum of the two lists of digits:
from itertools import product
for coords in product([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]):
    if sum(coords) == 10:

        return 
print "This cake is true"

For example, if the coordinates are (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(0,4),(0,5),(0,6),(0,7),(0,8),(0,9),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(1,7),(1,8),(1,9),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(2,7),(2,8),(2,9),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(3,7),(3,8),(3,9),(4,0),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(4,6),(4,7),(4,8),(4,9),(5,0),(5,1),(5,2),(

A:

"S" is a logical value
if "S" is True:

However, it seems you meant "S" should be a single character string
if "S" == "S":

You can actually do a comparison of two strings in Python.
To convert a string into a boolean value, use the bool() function.  To convert it back from a boolean value, use the bool() function.

A:

is_cake() is a good function name but the code is incorrect.
You need:
if S:
    # do something

or, better:
if S is True:
    # do something

====================
def is_cake(cake):
    """Check whether the cake is true"""
    if cake:
        return True
    else:
        return False

Next, using your pattern definition, we can do:
    assert is_cake(Toad), 'The toad is not a cake!'
    assert not is_cake(Bicycle), 'Bicycles are not cakes!'
    assert is_cake(Lemon), 'The lemon is a cake!'
    assert is_cake(Orange), 'The orange is a cake!'
    assert not is_cake(Cake), 'Cakes are not cakes!'
    assert not is_cake(Taro), 'The taro is not a cake!'
    assert not is_cake(Almond), 'The almond is not a cake!'
    assert not is_cake(Cheesecake), 'The cheesecake is not a cake!'
    assert not is_cake(Toad), 'The toad is not a cake!'
    assert not is_cake(Giraffe), 'The giraffe is not a cake!'
    assert not is_cake(StuffedCrab), 'The stuffed crab is not a cake!'
    assert not is_cake(Porridge), 'The porridge is not a cake!'

2.3. Exercises for you
The Exercises
Now, let us carry on and explore your pattern further. Can you think of anything you can add to the pattern which makes it clear exactly which cakes you mean? Can you make it even more general than the previous version?

A:

Yes, it is now perfectly clear what they are.  Is there anything else?

You could make them more generic, but that is probably not necessary.
Or, you can look at the constructor of Cake.  Python will print out the arguments for you if you call dir(Cake) to see the set of possible callables.  In this case, it is:
Cake(Cake, cakes)

All it does is instantiate the class, then uses the __init__ to call all of the named methods.

1st method
I guess this is how you distinguish each type of cake.  
As far as I know, if
====================
def is_cake(cake):
    """Check whether the cake is true"""
    for x in range(0, 9):
        if cake == [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]:
            return True
    return False

The compiler says:

    cake.split(None, None, None, '')
    return bool(all([condition in string for condition in cake]))

print(is_cake('['))

A:

Function *args(*args, **kwargs)
I found the solution!
The problem was that when all() is looking for condition in cake, it should be checked by condition.
def is_cake(cake):
    """Check whether the cake is true"""
    #the cake.split() is not needed
    return bool(all([condition in cake for condition in cake]))

A:

There are a few changes you need to make:

Change your for loop to a for loop (with one of the new statements): for cake in Cakes
Get rid of some of the unnecessary parentheses around the operations, because this is how Python distinguishes between operations and data types. Example: cake.color = 'black' is a data assignment, and the cake.color = black part is an operation. You can't assign a data type directly, you have to assign an instance of the data type.
Note that Cakes() takes no arguments.
You should rename your functions to make the code easier to understand and to follow your naming conventions.

A minimal example which will actually compile (I haven't tested it):
from random import choice

class Cakes():
    def is_black(self):
        """Check whether the cake is black"""
        if choice('black'):
            return True

    print "You found an apple, congratulations!"
elif is_cake(apple):

else:

The is_cake(apple) is never called. Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?

A:

Remember that you've used a def keyword to create a function named is_cake. You don't have to call it (at least not in this situation), so just change it to:
def is_apple(apple):
    """Check whether the apple is false"""
    return apple

And the same for the other function.

How to export a select options data to a JS Array?

I am developing a weather app using google maps API with few API that are listed as below :

This is what I was able to retrieve but I need to append all the option values into an array variable and update the value in the input box.

The statement gives consumers a clearer idea of what net neutrality means, which was struck down last month by the FCC's new Republican majority.

The three-page statement that accompanied the commission's vote, first reported by Recode, outlines the problems that the Commission believes led to the problems that contributed to its decision to end the "net neutrality" regulations: namely, that it was stifling innovation and violating the First Amendment.

"The previous net neutrality rules sought to impose upon broadband providers a permanent 'Light-Touch' regulation regime that failed to provide vital incentives for broadband innovation and deployment, in violation of the First Amendment. The earlier rules also treated Internet service

A:

To explain what your code is doing and why it's not working, let's take a look at your initialization of this_cake.
First, you're starting off with some complicated function that you are not using anywhere else:
    this_cake = 1 - (1 - (0.5 * a - 2 * (1-a) * a) ** (b - 1)) ** (-c + e * d) ** (f / (d * (f + 1)) - 1)

Here is a bit of a cleaner way to do the same thing:
def a(x):
    return 1 - (0.5 * x - 2 * (1-x) * x) ** (b - 1)
def b(x):
    return c
def c(x):
    return d
def d(x):
    return e
def e(x):
    return f
def f(x):
    return x / (d(x) * (f(x) + 1)) - 1

def calculate_this_cake():
    # Can't tell what this function does but it has to do something
    # before it returns a.
    a(a(a(a(a(a(1.0))))))

    return 1 - (1 - (0.5 * a - 2 * (1-a) * a) ** (b - 1)) ** (-c + e * d) ** (f / (d * (f + 1)) -

I want to add as few un-used vars as possible to my functon debug(..)

or is there a better way to do that?
This post explains well :

How to avoid eval in python?

Thank you!

A:

You can't avoid the use of eval (you don't have another option), but you can eliminate the need to use it. Instead of wrapping your key name in str, just return the key name directly:
def debug(m, cake):
    """debug method, output some debug info"""
    return {
        'cake': is_cake(cake),
       'm': m
    }

It will remove the use of eval:
In [11]: debug({'key1': None}, 'cake')
Out[11]: {'cake': True,'m': None}

You can always use break to get rid of indentation:

Just make sure your indentation is consistent.

A:

You've added an else block that returns false, while get_cake(22) doesn't seem to have any else. You must return something from that if clause, but if you don't it evaluates to False.

Also, elif should always be paired with an else clause.

Functionalized calix[6]arenes bearing either an exocyclic or endocyclic Tyr-aromatic unit as substituent were prepared through an unstratified Cu-catalyzed oxidative macrocyclization and subsequent copper-free oxidative cleavage of the remaining carbomethoxy groups. The use of the unstratified cyclization of a calix[6]arene and a chlorotrimethylsilane gives rise to triangulares while the use of a calix[6]arene and a pentachlorophenol affords two tetravalent fullerenes. It was found that the stability of the obtained triangulares or fullerenes can be tuned by tuning the cyclization strategy, halogenation of the aromatic residues and solvent, thereby providing a new type of second-generation calix[6]arenes.<|endoftext|>The increasing use of high-performance computing (HPC) on supercomputers and distributed computing clusters, as well as high-performance computing clouds, has created demand for efficient data storage solutions, particularly for data with a huge amount of storage capacity.

<|endoftext|> these results in the belief that differences in the preoperative prognosis are directly related to the various methods of managing the metastatic nodules, an essential characteristic of the method employed for managing the residual disease after the surgery. Since, in our opinion, surgical metastasectomy is based on a number of important factors (cytoreduction, complete surgical excision of the metastatic nodule and other diagnostic information regarding the patient), it was decided that such patients would receive adjuvant radiotherapy after an interval of 2 weeks. We do believe that such a strategy will improve the recurrence-free and survival rates, since it may be one of the reasons for the aforementioned results.

As a possible limitation of the current study, in addition to the fact that the patient population comprised primarily colon cancer patients, we have not performed further subgroup analysis, even though they may possibly constitute a subgroup, and due to the small number of patients. Other shortcomings of the current study are the retrospective nature of the study and the heterogeneity of the diagnostic and therapeutic methods.

Conclusion {#Sec9}
==========

We have found that preoperative treatment does not increase the rate of positive resection margins in patients with incomplete resection, and in addition, when there is a statistically significant difference in margin positivity, it seems that the number of patients with negative resection margins is significantly higher in the RT group than in the control group. This finding is of high significance for the cancer patients in this country and may contribute to a better preoperative prognosis, along with new and improved adjuvant therapy, for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. It is important to create protocols for effective preoperative staging for all types of rectal cancer and emphasize that, in such cases, an increase in the number of metastasized patients does not necessarily indicate worse preoperative prognosis, as only patients with a high risk of recurrence after incomplete resection should undergo preoperative therapy. It is a priority to consider the side effects of such treatment, and we believe that the decision to administer preoperative treatment must be taken by a multidisciplinary team, including surgeons, radiation oncologists and radiotherapists

What am I doing wrong here?

A:

What happens is that you call main() without actually calling the function.
try:
    main()
except NameError:
    main()

This is because python will be calling main() and then if it finds the main function doesn't exist it will call it again for you. So to fix it you just call the main function yourself. 
Try this:
import sys
import random
import time

def is_ant(a, b):
    """Check whether two values are true or not"""
    return a or b

def print_ant(a, b):
    """Print that a is not true"""

def main():
    a = True
    b = True
    print_ant(a, b)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

I made some other minor modifications as well.
As @Radu said you should just rename your main() function to run_game() and it will work just as you had intended.

To assess risk of premature labor, spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery and stillbirth in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with reproductive events (RE) compared to control subjects. All RE in four Finnish cities during a 13-year period (1985-1998) were identified from the databases of the local population-based hospital discharge registers and the registers of birth and death. A control group of women without SLE and without pregnancies was selected from the population register of the same cities using frequency matching on age. During the study period, 1464 women with SLE and 833 controls were identified with a median follow up time of 5.4 years. Women with SLE were more likely to deliver at the extremes of reproductive age and to have their first RE earlier. Compared to the control subjects, women with SLE had an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and preterm delivery. Women with SLE delivered prematurely (odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.42-2.40) and had their first pregnancy at an earlier

I thought that it would be a lot more simple to accomplish this task without having to write a loop for the whole problem but in my code it seems the if statement is not correct because it doesn't differentiate between true and false. Is there anything that I'm missing here or is this just a false-statement problem? Thanks!

A:

You're going in the right direction with this code. 
To solve your problem, try a simple one-line if statement like this:
if 'true' == 'true':
    print "The cake is a lie!"
else:
    print "The cake is true!"

EDIT: Here is what you had:
if selection == "true":
    cake = true

So, to simplify the if statement you can just do this:
if selection == "true":
    cake = True

I know this is a simple fix, but

A:

What you did is a great way to get feedback, however, there are other things to work on. 

There is no need for a wrapper function for the user input; you are only interested in that, so use raw_input()
if __name__ == '__main__': is not a good name for a function. Just call it main().
In main, you aren't actually calling your functions, so they are not being used. Change to: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

If you really want your functions to be not only meant to be called inside of main() but in the command-line, you should place them under a folder named "module" or something of the sort, and then do import module, and then do import module.__main__. That way, you will be able to use the function names as regular python function names.

What

This is the outcome of a consulting project I have been working on with the Risk Office.

We looked at the training needs of staff responsible for risk management and how the success of the business can be measured. It is an important subject to share with the rest of the organisation, as the nature of risk affects everyone in the business.

We also looked at the other services available within the Risk Office and how to incorporate them into the organisation.

def is_cake(cake):
    """Check whether the cake is true"""
    return cake

If someone provides False, a "False" string, or any other type that is not a boolean, it will evaluate to True. To check that something isn't True, use is_false():
def is_big_wheel(cake):
    """Check whether the cake is big"""
    if not is_false(cake):
        return is_false(cake)
    if is_cake(cake):
        return is_false(cake)
    return is_cake(cake)

Similarly, you can implement the same for the other two tests.

def is_cake(cake):

    if cake == True:
        print "This is a Cake"
    else:
        print "This is a fact."

is_cake(True)

A:

A function is not a return value. 
Also, you didn't use the def keyword, so you don't need an extra layer of brackets.
def is_cake():
    return True

is_cake()

A:

A function is a useful abstraction, to separate logic and calling. 
def is_cake():
    return True

print(is_cake())
# output : True

This way, you can keep logic and calling separated, even though the function is actually returning something (True in this case).
In addition, it allows you to reuse the logic in multiple places (in your case the print statement). 
If you didn't use a function, the logic and calling would be in the same line:
print(True)
# output : True

Which could then cause problems if the actual output of the logic was not True.
Note: The return value of the function is just for compatibility with the original is_cake(True). It is irrelevant to your question and you can simply change it as you wish.

<|endoftext|>How do I read a code without knowing its name?

A:

Quick Answer

According to WebMD, to "read" a code means to decipher the results of the medical tests on a patient's body. To "read" a code properly, it helps to know what the codes mean in relation to the patient's body and medications, as well as what the next step of testing is. According to WebMD, any medical test can be coded, including ultrasounds, blood tests and more.

Keep Learning

Medical coding is the science of decoding data and translating that data into a standard code. When medical data is recorded into a computer, that data is often "encoded" or translated into a standard code, such as 0010.0012, that is easier to recognize and translate, according to WebMD.<|endoftext|>Soybean-fermented steamed soybean (SSB) extract exerts an antipyretic effect in adjuvant-induced arthritis mice by activating the ERK signaling pathway.
