<|endoftext|>From a story to be released in December 2019 by E!/Femme, look forward to a review of How to Give to Transgender People by Rebecca Comay.

Another year, another conversation about giving. So, what’s this time around? Since 2010, more than 700 trans people in the United States have been killed due to fatal violence at the hands of police, in part, because of this climate of fear, and despite transgender people experiencing alarming rates of fatal hate crimes, more than 70% of all donors still choose to focus their giving on organizations that exclusively serve transgender people.

Does this speak to the relative dearth of attention that transgender issues have received in the mainstream conversation about philanthropy? Or maybe, it’s even a form of self-protection for organizations like those serving transgender people. Who would they be coming after if donors’ support wasn’t so vital?

Or are we missing the whole point of giving, that every dollar given is the opportunity for a truly transformative exchange to occur, and that our most effective philanthropy lies in our own personal practices and everyday interactions?

Still need convincing that philanthropy should shift its focus away from exclusively serving transgender people? I’ll offer you three reasons why that should be so.

1) Trans people get it. They understand what it’s like to live in an unjust society, and they’re determined to find solutions that will advance the human rights of all people.

When transgender rights were thrust into the spotlight, trans people and their allies gave life to an uncommonly potent type of philanthropy, one that serves the marginalized and working class, rather than the conventional globalist circles where traditional philanthropy often favors. Community-based projects like the Trans Pride March, NYCTransgender Health Conference and Trans Pride in RVA were born from a collective sense that mainstream organizing and advocacy wasn’t addressing the needs of trans people in a way that gave them agency. The inherent assumption of liberal philanthropy is that people know what’s best for them and their communities. But as a trans woman and human rights organizer, I know that when marginalized people

Topological sort from a custom stack data structure

So, I have been experimenting with topological sorts recently and found that we can write one using a custom stack data structure.
A topological sort of a given list [v1, v2, v3,..., vn] starts with all elements in the list represented by the stack as 0 and then we pop off the top two elements from the stack. If that leaves a single element in the stack we pop off that element and then pop off the next two elements from the stack. The top element from the stack represents the first element in the list that we have not yet popped off and the second element from the stack represents the second element that we have not yet popped off. This continues until we have popped off all elements from the stack. We then process the list in the order determined by the top two elements on the stack. If we have the same elements in the stack we leave them in the stack and if we have the last element on the stack we remove the element from the stack and use the element on top of the stack to represent the new top element on the stack and start the process all over again.
From an algorithm point of view this is the same as the standard way of doing it, but we can

A:

As it is pretty big, your best option might be to use BeautifulSoup and the take a look at the source for that part.
There are a couple of things to be aware of:
1.) Your code might work on another machine, if you copy the page source of the.RData to your harddrive and then run the code.
2.) You are trying to get the text in the title tag.
There is no easy way to only get one of those tags as it is a nested element and therefore there would need to be a way to grab that tag as well.
I have included a working example of what I mean.
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

page = requests.get("https://www.infermed.com/journal-article/if-mrc1-knock-out-in-human-dendritic-cells-interferes-with-naive-and-memory-t-cell-activation")

soup = BeautifulSoup(content, "lxml")

titles = soup.findAll('div', attrs={'class': "details"})

for i, titles in enumerate(titles):
    for titles in titles:
        text.append(titles.contents[0].get_text().strip()+'\n')
        print(titles.contents[0].get_text().strip())

print(text[4].strip())

A German naval officer was injured today after his bomb-laden motorboat collided with a shipping container vessel in the Gulf of Finland, sending shrapnel flying in the air and sending a huge wave smashing against the hull of the third vessel in a line of ships on the way to the Kola Peninsula, Russia.

Around 1:45pm the collision occurred in the Sea of Åland waters between the Baltic port of Tallinn, Estonia and the Finnish town of Salla.

A Dvina class missile boat from the Finnish navy, the Valkyria, lost its keel. The bow of the ship is missing, in addition to an antenna, watertight doors, some paintwork and electronic control systems.

As a result of the crash and the subsequent wave, a motorboat from the German navy, the Gustaf III, hit the Valkyria's starboard, or right-hand side, damaging the stern, but avoiding serious injuries.

The Valkyria was being towed back to the port of Salla, Finland, where it will undergo repairs. The Gustaf III was taken to the Gulf of Finland and will be moved to the

If you open your web browser, and hit the link that you want to extract the text from, you will see it's full text, not just the code. If you want only the code, then you must modify your html code in the web browser so it shows just that. 
If you want to get the text from an html file, you can download it first to your local disk and open the text file from there. In other words, read this page http://www.google.com/translate_t - you will see that the source code does not show the full text but the translation from English to Spanish. 
One more thing, if you want to extract all text from the web pages, you might want to use Requests + lxml to read all the content, but when you find a text string you want, you might want to use BeautifulSoup to parse the text and extract only the text you need. 

<|endoftext|>1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for encoding and decoding an image and a medium for storing a program for encoding and decoding an image, and in particular to a method and apparatus for encoding and decoding an image for use in storage of image data, and a medium for storing a program for encoding and decoding an image.
2. Description of the Related Art
With the spread of the Internet, an image transmitted through a public line is rapidly transmitted, stored, and processed. Hence, a high-quality image can be transmitted.
In order to transmit the image, it is first necessary to encode the image data, and compress the image data before transmission. In order to transmit a high-quality image in real time, a compression technique is necessary to handle the data. As compression techniques for such high-quality image data, a lossless compression technique such as JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) for an image and JPEG2000 for a still image, and a lossy compression technique such as MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) for moving images have been standardized. Such compression techniques compress a large amount of information.
For example, in JPEG, all blocks (for example, 8×8 pixels)

I'm getting a print like this:

I'd like to get rid of dnx, 'dnx sdk', etc. (so I can ignore the irrelevant parts) and just have date, sdk, next, vstcoreunittests, etc.
Can someone tell me how I can do that?

A:

You can use regex here to find this pattern
dnx [A-Z].*

Then you can use the findall() function to get all the relevant strings
import re
regex = r"dnx [A-Z].*"
strings = re.findall(regex, my_string)

A:

The script uses the HTML elements IDs attribute (see the script in a working example) to search for the element you want. As you mentioned in the comments, you have several classes instead of ids in the page, so you have to filter the results by that.
This is the working script with you class names:

What is causing this? I'm new to the BeautifulSoup package so I might be missing something simple, but I cannot see it.

A:

You are running your script too early, the site you're scraping first loads the content into the browser and only after you start scraping the page in your script.
You need to start the script when the page is completely loaded in the browser:
#!/usr/bin/env python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

URL = 'https://www.ebookpublisher.co.uk/help/sales/thumb/login.php'

r = requests.get(URL)
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')

# Script started
print("Script started")
# Get the text from target webpage
extractor = HTMLExtractor()
content = extractor.extract(URL)
print(content)
# Get the last paragraph and print it out
print(content.select(".test"))
#
====================
def extract_text(url):
    """Get the text from target webpage"""
    page = requests.get(url)
    html = page.content
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml')
    title = soup.select_one('[title="Tetris Block"]').get_text()
    first_image = soup.select_one('[href^="/video/thumb.jpg"]')
    if first_image:
        thumb = first_image.get('src')
        print("In video", url, "Thumb", thumb)
    else:
        print("No video found in", url)
        title = soup.select_one('[title="Tetris Block"]').get_text()
    body_text = soup.select('div#body')
    for i in body_text:
        if (i.string.strip()).split("-")[0] == "Tetris Block":
            block = i.get_text(strip=True)
            print(url, "Block", block)

The code can run but there is no output. Do I need to do any sort of encoding before I extract the data? The actual program works when I use the print(block) in-front of the for loop but not within the for loop.

A:

You're calling get_text() from the body_text elements, which doesn't make any sense. Your for loop shouldn't be inside the body_text elements.
I think you're looking for this:
for i in soup.select("div#body"):
    if (i.string.strip()).split("-")[0] == "Tetris Block":
        block = i.get_text(strip=True)
        print(url, "Block", block)

In the 21st century, Asian-Pacific countries are facing an epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), along with a growing burden of cancer. In this paper, we report the perspective of the NCD field of the Asian-Pacific region from 2006 to 2011. For the first time, a list of articles published during this period on the NCD field in Asia-Pacific countries is presented. The information was compiled from annual reports of the Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean of the World Health Organization (WHO), from the annual reports and publications of the Member States of the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific, from references from those annual reports, and from articles extracted from relevant journals and other reports in the NCD field. The data obtained were presented in a framework that addressed three aspects of the NCD problem: public health-related interventions, clinical management of NCDs, and research

I'd be interested in receiving some advices. I've been fighting with this script for some time.

A:

If your goal is to parse HTML for specific pieces of text then you can do this with an html parser, a DOM parser, or with lxml. The last two options are more robust than the first.
lxml:
from lxml import html

html_doc = html.parse(page_text)
text = html_doc.xpath(
    '//text()[normalize-space()]//text()[normalize-space()]/text()'
)

Here we're using normalize-space to get rid of all whitespace between the results. This will give you a list of all the non-whitespace characters in the results.
DOM:
from xml.dom import minidom

text_dom = minidom.parseString(page_text)
text = [t.text for t in text_dom.childNodes]

I've looked up various solutions to this issue, and tried to apply them to my problem but have had no success. Any help would be appreciated.

A:

You're applying the dict() function to the key of the dictionary.
The error is due to this dictionary having unhashable values in its keys. To avoid this you should use dict.setdefault() to return a default value if the key is not present.
dic = {}
for i in kwargs(book):
    if dic.setdefault(i, None) is None:

Now let's search the text of all the blog posts in our website for the term "Sometext", and for every match we'd like to see the exact URL of the source of the post:

    res = []
    soup = bs(text, 'html.parser')
    posts = soup.find_all('div', {'class':'t-box-content'})
    for post in posts:
        post_text = post.find('a').text.replace('</a>', '').strip()
        if 'Sometext' in post_text:
            source_url = extract_text(post.a['href'])
            res.append([source_url, post_text])
    return res

You can then display the res list in the console using something like this:
for src, post_text in res:
    print(src, post_text)

Notice how I use the list comprehension from above.

<|endoftext|>Development and evaluation of an integrated teaching resource for functional scapulohumeral and thoracic joint mobilization techniques.
Scapulothoracic pain is highly prevalent in the general population, affecting up to 30% of adults, and has been correlated with such conditions as fibromyalgia, upper limb orthopedic injury, and neck pain. While scapular mobilization has been shown to be an effective treatment strategy for neck pain, the most commonly used mobilization techniques (scapular glide and rib glide) have only limited clinical effectiveness. The aim of this study was to design and evaluate a multimedia teaching resource designed to provide the learner with theoretical and practical information on the clinical use of scapulohumeral and thoracic joint mobilization techniques for the treatment of scapulothoracic pain.

If I was trying to parse XML like that in Python, I'd use a library like xml.etree.cElementTree to parse the page.
To achieve that you'd probably need something like this:
import urllib2
import re
import lxml.etree

page = open('http://www.girlsdiary.com/Hats-and-Accessories-5-14-14-5.html', 'rb')
root = lxml.etree.parse(page).getroot()
hats = root.xpath("//div[@id='main_col3']/table[@class='jqxListBox_all']/tr/td[1]/div[@class='jqx-list-item-container']/ul/li")
for x in hats:
    if not re.match('open-',x.text):
        hat = lxml.etree.Element('th')
        open_url = 'http://www.girlsdiary.com/'+x.text+'.html'
        hat.text = x.text
        open_url.append(hat)
        root.xpath('//div[@id='main_col3']/table[@class='jqxListBox_all']/tr/td[1]/div[@class='jqx-list-item-container']/ul/li')[-1].append(open_url)
print(root)

which will print:
<lxml.etree._ElementTree object at 0x10764f0d0>
[<Element 'th' at 0x10776b0e8>, <Element 'th' at 0x10776e768

    sourceCode.encoding = "utf-8"
    sourceCode = sourceCode.text
    sourceCode = re.sub(r"\r\n", " ", sourceCode)
    return sourceCode.split()

I need to match the content between [], by removing everything except the content that has the regex pattern {property} and replace all {property} to {property}, and I also need to trim() all the lines except for the first line. 
So the result should be as follows:
[
  {
    "property": "good",
    "name": "new name"
  },
  {
    "property": "impossible",
    "name": "other name"
  }
]

What is the appropriate regex pattern for this?

A:

A regex approach using capturing groups to match the data you want to keep and replace it, and use backreferences to replace each occurence of the match (since we only need the first occurence)
import re

x = '[
  {
    "property": "good",
    "name": "new name"
  },
  {
    "property": "impossible",
    "name": "other name"
  }
]'

s = re.sub(r"(?<=\[)\s*{([^}]*)\}\s*(?=\[)", r"\1", x)
print(s)

<|endoftext|>Although there are a few technical difficulties, your letter was read and we have some suggestions.

Is he a monk? "Here in Capetown, as in other similar Southern towns, the enthusiasm and genius of the Portuguese races appear most in the monuments of the Catholic church," he says. Would he have stopped at the church in the middle of the African bush? "The melancholy consolations of religion," he says, "alone sustain and comfort the unfortunate natives when wandering in the fields and desolated forests, crushed by affliction and expiring under the scorching rays of the sun." Is he alive? He is dead, a Roman Catholic priest, writing in 1869.

It's interesting how much of a change the title will make. It's dead. Of that, at least. Then, it was "a melancholy consolations of religion", which doesn't make for a bad story, especially not if you're British.

So to answer your question, he is dead. Then, he's alive. He's dead, then he's alive. Which is a bit tricky, really. Also, it could be him as a priest, or it could be a real priest writing

I am using Python 3.7.3 on Windows 10.
I would also like to note that the "text" is not the original text. For example, if I entered "test" as the code, then the output text would be "TEST".
However, this code does not work and it returns:
Please enter text: test
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'url' referenced before assignment

Why is the variable being referenced before it is defined, and how to resolve this?
Thanks.

A:

Two immediate issues in your code:

If you are on Python 3, use from urllib.request import urlretrieve
The standard way to download a page is urlretrieve, as stated here
urlretrieve("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/test", "text.txt")

However, you do not need to save the file and instead you can just open the file straight away in your target url:
if (len(code) == 0):
    print("Enter a non-empty string")
    return

with open("text.txt", "wb") as text:

Excel Find function with multiple criteria

I have the following string array
Cases$:
0:     5
1:     4
2:     5
3:     4
4:     5
5:     4
6:     2
7:     1
8:     2
9:     1
10:    1
11:    3

And I want to use Excel Find() function with multiple criteria.
For example, to find string "4" in column "Cases" I have used: 

=FIND("4", $C$2:$C$21)

Result: "4"
I am trying to make a VBA function for multiple criteria
The formula to do it should be:
Function FIND(Criteria, SheetName, Cell)

But I couldn't make it work. Can anybody help?

A:

If I'm interpreting your requirements correctly, you want to FIND something in a list of values.  The criteria could be in a separate range or, in this example, in the values in your first range (Cases).
The concept is to provide an ARRAY formula to FIND, something like this:
=FIND(Criteria, ARRAYFORMULA(Cases), Cell)

You can then copy that formula and edit the parameters and then drag it down until the final results are populated.
I'm not sure why you have the sheet name, and Cell, but I think that's only relevant if you are using them as VLOOKUP parameters (hope I'm interpreting that right).

My problem is when I do my usual extract text function:
https://eumak.live/reader.php?posts=7
https://eumak.live/reader.php?posts=12
Both codes should return me the title text. How can I do this?

A:

The problem with your extract_text method is that the http requests for your page is asynchronous, this means that you are making a http request and when that request finished the the page content is ready, but your code is not waiting for the http request to finish.
The solution is to use the builtin feature of the requests library to make sure the request you send is a synchronous request, thus, the code will wait for the response.
import requests

def extract_text(url):
    source_code = requests.get(url).text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(source_code, 'lxml')

    return soup.prettify(formatter="markdown").encode('utf-8')

text = extract_text('https://eumak.live/reader.php?posts=7')
