# gpt-3-experiments

A repo containing test prompts for [GPT-J-6B](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax) and the resulting AI-generated texts, which illustrate the model's capabilities for code generation given a function or class definition. All generated texts in this repo are _completely unedited and uncurated_. There should be no harmful/offensive output, unless poorly optimized code is considered harmful.

Each .txt file contains 50 generations at 512 length, top_p = 0.9, temperature = 1.0.
