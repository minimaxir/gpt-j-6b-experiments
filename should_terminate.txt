there is another file with that function
and at the end of the file it is stated :
from.utilities import *

now i want to use that function within the file where I import the utilities and get the error :
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/me/workspace/py/../main.py", line 14, in <module>
    import utils.utilities as u
  File "/home/me/workspace/py/utils/utilities.py", line 15, in <module>
    from.utilities import *
ImportError: cannot import name should_terminate

why doesn't that work and what can I do about it?

A:

This module does not have a __all__. You need to define the should_terminate() function in a module and define an __all__ that says that this module is in.
The error has nothing to do with utilities. In a module __all__ you don't list names, you list things. Your __all__ should be __all__ = ['utilities.utilities'] (that's one way to get it)

by librarian@excite.com (she who watches far too much tv)

Do you watch the amount of screen time you use? I had to set a time on my computer (determined by date & time settings) that I had to stop using it for certain activities, including tv and texting. It wasn’t hard (I’m not as addicted to internet as I used to be), but I have had to accept that certain hours are lost to me. I’m not quite to the point where I watch tv every single day, but it has gotten much better. It’s not easy and sometimes I think “why can’t I be as productive or have as many time-saving inventions as those famous tv-watching execs?” but I have my moments.

I do feel that our children have become far too accustomed to a 24/7 tv culture and haven’t any concept of outside activity like reading and imaginative play. The school I work for supports children who are off for some reason and have books in the library which they take

Cleanest Way to Verify an Intensive loop has terminated without raising an error

I am running a massive loop with Python, and I'd like to verify that the loop has finished before attempting to save anything to files. Currently, I run a check on the return value of the loop using the if command, and if it fails to terminate I raise an error that the process has not terminated:
result = max(x[i:i + 1] for i in range(0, len(x), 1))
# repeat while not True
while not result

PersonalAssistants obviously have no __init__() in the same way Person is protected. 
But if I run Person() again, only Person.__init__() is executed.
Did I misunderstand the "protection" mechanism?

A:

In Python 3, Python's implementation of object introspection is based on the super() call. In your case, PersonalAssistant().__class__ is equal to Person. Python passes the function and returns the result as an object. This is why the super() call also works in this case.
As a consequence, the method you've written, should_terminate(), is invoked, and thus return True in each instance of Person.

Is there a context in our lives that is completely unchanged by what we do?

For the time being I am not interested in the "how is it possible" part of the question, for instance the universe has infinitely many possible "current states", that differ only by choice of some initial conditions,
what I am interested in is if there is a current state where the result is not affected by choices made, I mean "fixed point" where the total sum of the consequences of every choice we make is exactly the same no matter which choice we make. In other words, any attempt we make to choose better in some aspect of our lives ends up changing nothing. 
The question is: Is there such a context? 

A:

Well, I think your question can be reduced to this:

Is there a context in our lives that is entirely unaffected by what we do? 

And the answer is:

Yes.

This answer is subjective, but I'll try to justify this assertion:

This is because the "solution" of the universe is the same at any given moment in time, it is a solution that evolves with time, i.e. there are no "fixed points", but there are certain relative invariant properties of the solutions.

Perhaps the best way of explaining what I mean is by pointing out that the universe doesn't know what you will do when.

<|endoftext|>Q:

How do I align a list of annotations on a ttk.Treeview?

I've been using a list of annotations to point to various parts of a multidimensional Python list. To add a new annotation, I'm using the Treeview's ttk.Treeview.insert() function. The insertion point is very precise, however, which is why I want to add it in the corner of the treeview. The problem is the annotations get automatically added as if they were all aligned on the bottom of the treeview. Here is a sample code:
import Tkinter as tk
import ttk

treeview = ttk.Treeview(column=1, show='headings', columns=('Column'))
treeview.column('Column', width=100)

treeview.pack(side='left')

annotation = [ 'column 1',
               'column 2',
               'column 3',
               'column 4',
               'column 5',
               'column 6',

I'm not a Python expert, so feel free to give any tips about this!

A:

Another, more idiomatic way to do this is with asyncio. In my view it's usually better to go with asyncio where it's applicable. Your code example does seem to have a problem, though, so I'll try to address both approaches.
The ExitService class looks a bit like it should just be a class, though; this will keep you from messing around with multiple object instances. It's not too surprising, since
====================
def should_terminate(Person):
    """Check whether a Person should be terminated"""
    return bool(score)  # "Person with score <= 0.7 terminates"

I would like to make the should_terminate method as a mixin class. This class may have different parameters like below. The "score" parameter is optional.
class Person:

    def terminate(self, score=None):
        """Check whether a Person should be terminated"""
        if score <= 0.7:
            return True
        else:
            return False

A:

The should_terminate mixin looks like a good fit for a StatefulPattern. It has to return a new "self" after it has been called.
class Person(object):

    terminate_possible = False

    def is_terminated(self):
        return self.terminate_possible

    def terminate(self, score=None):
        if score <= 0.7:
            self.terminate_possible = True
            return True
        else:
            return False

Person.terminate_possible = False
# Person.terminate(score=0.9)  # True
Person.terminate(score=0.9)  # False

The score is an optional parameter because you want to change that when is_terminated is called, while retain the ability to check with termination_possible at all times.
Side note: This can be done in a much more Pythonic way:
class Person(object):

    terminate_possible = False

    def is_terminated(self):
        return self.terminate_possible

    def terminate(self, score=None):
        return score <= 0.7

    def terminate_with_score(self, score):
        self.terminate_possible =

def should_terminate(Person):

    should_terminate = 0 if Person.should_terminate else 1
    return should_terminate

Each agent can use this function to make decisions. For example, an agent could decide to terminate the human by detecting that he would rather spend some time in the kitchen. The robots thus learn how to behave according to the laws of physics (push a cabinet and get hit).
All agents can share information in their local histories with the robot (as well as with each other), to make a decision. Each local history contains a list of objects, and a list of actions performed to affect those objects. 
The local history $H_i(p,t)$ of agent $i$ at time $t$ includes the set of objects $o_i(p,t)$, the actions $a_i(p,t)$ of agent $i$ at time $t$, and the set of objects $o_j(p,t)$ where $j \in A_i$ and $j \neq i$. $A_i$ is the set of agents where agent $i$ can share information.
Note that the history $H_i$ of an agent $i$ includes only information available to $i$. This is different from what some other similar games do (e.g. [1]). It is justified as, in my opinion, when an agent can share information it can also observe it. 
For example, if $i$ is in the kitchen and its neighbours can see its action, it can be deduced from their observation of its action that it is in the kitchen. 
Now, the question is: how do agents learn? And, in particular, how do they learn to learn? 
To my knowledge, most learning algorithms use a list of training instances, where each training instance is a tuple $(S,A,o,p,t)$ where $S$ is the set of states where the agent is located, $A$ is the set of actions available to the agent, $o$ is the observation of the agent, $p$ is the initial state of the agent, and $t$ is the timestamp. The learner would be expected to create a good policy given some training examples. 
In this application, the training set is hard to come by, as it involves solving a dynamic problem. In my case, each agent's observation $o

My concern is that initialize should be returning a special Person that is invalid.
The Person class has a bunch of specialized initialization functions and none of them raise an exception.  That's what I want:

someone should not be in the list if they aren't alive.
if you start a Person and then another Person, the Person in the middle should not be garbage collected.  Ideally it should inherit and the other Person can be garbage collected.
Someone can be in a list of live but unknown people.

It would be great if initialize just created and returned a Person object.  But maybe it doesn't have to be a class?
I realize this would be best if implemented in the constructor.  But I'm not quite sure how to get there.
I really want initialize to just create and return a valid Person.  I want to keep the Person class to represent death and life.  I'm concerned that a terminating Person could keep a person in the list for too long.  Is there a way to make the termination case part of the termination state?
I just noticed that I could implement Person.__init__ as:
class Person:
    def __init__(self, *args):
        super(Person, self).__init__(*args)
        if should_terminate(self):
            raise...
        else:
           ... # For initialization

This seems like it violates the principle of least surprise.  I don't want to say that a Person can't have an initializer because that would mean initialize would

def should_terminate(Person):
    """Check whether a Person should be terminated"""
    try:
        if Person.fitness_level <= 0.5:
            return True
    except Exception:
        return False

How can I make this work? 

A:

A few problems here. Firstly, your code has an unnecessary indentation after def should_terminate(Person):. So that should be changed to:
def should_terminate(Person):
    """Check whether a Person should be terminated"""
    try:
        if Person.fitness_level <= 0.5:
            return True
    except Exception:
        return False

And your function needs to be named as should_terminate, not as should_terminate, because that's what the method name is for (the function name is then used for the docstring).
Secondly, fitness_level is a string and not a float, so it needs to be changed to:
if Person.fitness_level <= 0.5:
    return True
else:
    return False

Finally, note that a try-except-return-statement is similar to if-statement. So this is not what you want:
except Exception:
    return False

You are better of just checking if the object has a value that is false:
if Person.fitness_level <= 0.5:
    return True
return False

Since you mention that the person model is a constructor, you also need to change the class Person to return values instead of objects:
class Person(object):
    """Class containing a person's name, fitness_level and fitness_deterministically"""
    def __init__(self, name, fitness_level, fitness_deterministically):
        self.name = name
        self.fitness_level = fitness_level
        self.fitness_deterministically = fitness_deterministically

In this way, the __init__-function will check the arguments of the constructor and only
====================
def should_terminate(Person):
    """Check whether a Person should be terminated"""
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p = Person()
    print "create"
    print p
    p.do_something()
    print "after"
    print p
    if should_terminate(p):
        p.terminate()

This prints out:
create
<person.Person instance at 0x105877a90>
create
<person.Person instance at 0x105877a90>
after
<person.Person instance at 0x105877a90>
create
<person.Person instance at 0x105877a90>
after
<person.Person instance at 0x105877a90>
terminate
<person.Person instance at 0x105877a90>

This implies that the object created in the for-loop still has the state of the original, even after the change to Person.p_a and Person.p_b.
I know that I can fix this by manually changing the.__dict__ of the original Person object, like this:
for k in Person.__dict__:
    if not k.startswith("__"):
        Person.__dict__[k] = Person.__dict__.pop(k)

This way, p is no longer defined when Person.p_a and Person.p_b change. However, I have no idea how I can reach this from within the.do_something() function.
Any help would be appreciated!

A:

The reason why they are not updated is because Person is a class, which is not evaluated every time you want to access a member.
But you can just refactor the loop to be:
for p in Person.__iter__():
    if not p.p_a or not p.p_b:
        continue

It seems a little cumbersome, but it gets the job done:

First, make Person a class (or if not, make it mutable) and
Make it available as an iterator.

You should return the last evaluated expression. And then, if you need the "success" status you should:

<|endoftext|>Kattugoda Temple

Kattugoda Temple or Kattugoda Maha Deva Temple, is one of the major temples in Udumalalaha, Kalutara District, Sri Lanka. It was one of the first of the Buddha statues to be brought to the island.

History
The stone statue is believed to be brought to the island by King Vijayaditya of Kotte (r. 1428–1435) from Mahamegala, which is not far from today's Kattugoda. Legend has it that the original statue was destroyed by a flood, which left behind a pedestal, as a memorial.

The pedestal has later been incorporated into a larger temple. Some additional fragments of the original statue were found and now rest at the National Museum in Colombo.

What is the right way to apply changes to database?

I'm having a small bit of an issue with the following scenario and am looking for the right approach. I'm writing a java program that reads the contents of a directory and then sends the contents of the directory to the database. I've worked on this a bit in the past and built a working program that wrote new content to a table in the database and didn't change the contents of the directory at all. So my table in the database looked something like this...
The file name column has unique indexes on it and my table is setup with a PK. So for example, the table looks like this...

directory                   file_name                 directory
file_01              
====================
def should_terminate(Person):
    """Check whether a Person should be terminated"""
    if m.Person.should_terminate(Person):
        return True

    return False

The problem is when the player chooses not to terminate a person:
print(`You don't want to terminate person #${m.Person.id}`)

And terminates the person:
print(`You did terminate person #${m.Person.id}`)

# Stop the world

When choosing to terminate the person, the world terminates and no future action is performed.
With my implementation of Player, the game's world should terminate as soon as the "Stop the world" button is pressed. Instead of that, the world remains active and no action is performed.
It's probably something pretty basic that I'm just missing, but I'm fairly new to Python, and I'd be thankful for some help.
Thank you.

A:

You're doing a lot of redundant work, and I'm not sure what the point of PersonManager is (it feels like it's a collection of functions and objects). The Person class also looks unnecessary, and person = m.Person(person_id) is unnecessary, you can just reference the ID.
Here is a version of your code, rewritten to use as little global state as possible, by only looking at m. Note that Player shouldn't necessarily be a class.
from random import randint
from datetime import timedelta

def should_terminate(person):
    """Check whether a Person should be terminated"""
    if person.should_terminate:
        return True
    return False

def create_random_person(person_id):
    """Generate a new random Person"""
    player = Person(person_id)
    player.duration = randint(5, 10)
    return player

def should_pause(person):
    """Check whether a Person should be paused"""
    if should_terminate(person):
        return True

def should_terminate(Person):
    """Check whether a Person should be terminated"""
    if person.life_expectancy < 20:
        return True
    else:
        return False

And lastly, a die_if_terminated function. This function checks if a person should be terminated, and if it does, terminates the person and returns True.
# This function checks if a person should be terminated.
# If the person should be terminated, then True is returned
def die_if_terminated(Person):
    """Check if a Person should be terminated"""
    if Person.life_expectancy < 20:
        return True
    else:
        return False

A:

Remember that if you just want to access private attributes, you don't need to do Person.whatever because Person.whatever is essentially syntactic sugar for this.attr.
That said, you could write it like this:
def should_terminate(Person):
    """Check whether a Person should be terminated"""
    return person.life_expectancy < 20

And this works, because here you're not referring to any of the Person instance variables. So the person attribute gets looked up, and if it's in the class you're in, it'll work.

PS: I am using Python 3.6.4.

A:

In Python, always do one thing in a function. If it does more than one thing, break it up into two functions, one to do one thing, and another to do the other thing.
Here, you do two things. For starters, the def in the first function does nothing, so remove that. Now you can decide whether to return something or not, and your code for filtering should be in its own function, as well.

def should_terminate(Person):
    """Check whether a Person should be terminated"""
    if Person.age > 100:
        return True

    if Person.birth_year < 1970:
        return True

    if Person.relationship_status == 'Unavailable':
        return True

    return False

At the moment it just terminates the test at the point where it returns True. However, how do I write a test that would make this method actually terminates the test?

A:

Unless you return a specific result, normally your test would just continue, as per the idea of a non-deterministic test. In your case, it will continue until it finds a false-positive (a person that should be terminated but it fails). That could be a problem for you, because you expect to terminate based on certain conditions and your test won't stop until all such conditions are met.
To get around that, you can use an assertion, or set a global variable to something specific and check that. If you use a boolean global variable, you can use assertFalse(should_terminate(Person)) to ensure your Person is not terminated. You could also use something like setattr(Person,'should_terminate', False) to only check when it is True.
However, if you do this, you may end up with false positives in the code if the should_terminate condition is ever met on a test. So if you want to use the should_terminate concept, you need to do it in a way that won't really cause a problem. For example, maybe instead of setting a variable, you could instead update the code to decide whether or not to terminate the Person, like the following:
class Person:

    def __init__(self, age=None, birth_year=None, relationship_status=None):
        self.age = age
        self.birth_year = birth_year
        self.relationship_status = relationship_status
        self.should_terminate = should_terminate(self)

    def should_terminate(self):
        """Check whether a Person should be terminated"""
        if
====================
def should_terminate(Person):
    """Check whether a Person should be terminated"""
    def cancel():
        self.terminated = True
        raise CancelException()
    @provider.handler(should_terminate)
    def handle(person):
        """This can be implemented as a test"""
        print("Ran: ", person.name)
        person.cancel()
        return True

@provider.provider(should_terminate)
class SomethingTerminating(Terminating):
    def should_terminate(Person):
        """This tests a Person's terminate method"""
        return True

def should_terminate(Person):

    if not isinstance(Person, Person):
        raise TypeError("We must check the type of Person, but got %s instead." % Person)
    return Person.expiration < time.time()

As you can see the Person class needs a property like expiration which can be set to some date in the future and should be checkable, so I wouldn't be surprised if this was done in some kind of library which takes care of these things for you.
Now, since Person is a User we can add some additional properties like points or something. The trick is that the User implementation needs to extend the Person one, like:
class User(Person):
    """A human being who gives points"""

    points = 0
    for _ in range(100):
        points += 1

    def earn_points(self):
        """Earns points by performing some actions"""
        self.points += 1
        return self.points

Now, this is a Person, the default one. As you can see this is a lot of code for this "Person only" thing. If this wasn't required by an external library and the User was just an int we would have a lot less code. 
So, this is the idea behind a factory. You can do it by inheritance, like:
class PersonFactory(object):
    """Creates instances of a Person"""
    def create_person(self, expiration):
        """Create and return a person"""
        if expiration <= time.time():
            raise ValueError("A person can only be created if the expiration time is in the future.")
        try:
            return Person(expiration)
        except TypeError:
            raise TypeError("Expected Person")
        except ValueError:
        
====================
def should_terminate(Person):
    """Check whether a Person should be terminated"""
    if not Person.should_terminate():
        return False
    for r in Person.get_reported():
        if r.should_terminate():
            return True
    return False

These functions accept arguments that they can mutate. 
This will fail with
Person.should_terminate(0)

as Person.should_terminate() already returned a result, so it's up to the
compiler to not allow a call to Person.should_terminate() before the function
returns.
In this specific case I can see that you're trying to check if Person.person is
a TruePerson.person.py:119 person attribute, so maybe change the last if to if
Person.person.should_terminate():

The captured image is often processed to attempt to remove, or at least reduce, the noise or image artifacts. In some cases, pre-processing or filtering may be applied to the image before further processing is performed. Conventional image processing techniques, however, often fail to adequately address image noise.
Therefore, an improved approach is desired for reducing image noise.<|endoftext|>In part one of the “Restoring an Old Vehicle” video tutorial series we showed you how to check your motor, belts, water pump, gaskets and hoses.

The next step is to change the oil, as an engine oil level light is seen on the dash for every “r” in the “little m” OIL R ……?

If this is your first car then it is good practice to change the oil before it gets completely full. The key is to get it into the lowest setting for a bit so the engine hasn’t sat in oil for an extended period of time. A similar oil change technique can be used on a 4 wheel drive vehicle. You will need to lift the rear of the vehicle to get the wheels off so the cross member can be removed. This gives
