When this code is run in IDLE it returns
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 12, in <module>
    print(g.car)
NameError: name 'car' is not defined

This is the same, in slightly different syntax, as in the book. Why is there a NameError, and how can it be fixed?

A:

In python, you don't always have to prefix class names with a capital letter. See http://docs.python.org/2/reference/keywords.html#user-defined-keywords
When you have class name defined as class Car:
You should use the syntax class Car: to actually use it. To refer to instances of this class as car. 
And since your class uses some global variables, the class definition must be global. In order for this to work, you must have the global line above the class definition. The class object is created only when it is accessed through the actual class name (not using.car) so you'll have to use the actual class name in order to have the attribute in the first place.
So you should change this line of code:
print(g.car)

to this:
print(g.Car.car)

I don't understand why it doesn't accept the name of my function in the init function.

A:

If I understand your code correctly you are calling the init function of the Car class from within another class, and you are referring to the init function by a variable called x which is assigned to a variable from another class. This is not going to work. 
You cannot use class variables (variables that are part of a class object) from a method of a different class, this is possible for instance variables (variables that are only available to the specific method in which they are

I think it has something to do with the fact that the car instance variable is a method but not an actual instance of a class. Could anyone explain how this problem could be fixed? Thanks!

A:

You need to provide a class name while defining a class. In your code, Car() is a function. What you need is a class with name Car. Hence, change it to:
class Car:
    """A class used to represent a car"""
    def drive(self, car, time):
        """Drive the car for the specified amount of time"""

Alternatively, you can just change your first line in the code to:
class Car:
    """A class used to represent a car"""

And, of course, the final line of code should be changed to:
if __name__ == '__main__':

        self.model = model

        return self.make

# Create a new car
my_car = Car('ford','mustang', '2015')

# This prints "2015 ford mustang"

# Set a new model for this car
my_car.model = 'camaro'

# This prints "2015 camaro"
print(my_car.get_year())

# This prints "2015 ford mustang"
print(my_car.get_model())

# This is the same as the old method
print(my_car.get_make())

# Add a new model for this car
my_car.model ='suzuki'

# This prints "2015 camaro"
print(my_car.get_year())

# This prints "2015 ford mustang"
print(my_car.get_model())

# This prints "2015 suzuki"
print(my_car.get_make())

A:

def __init__(self, make, model, year):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year

You call this function to initialize, but then don't use the instance of Car you created with the call. So every subsequent function is really just referring to a different car.
If you want to set these instance variables to be "lazy", you need to save them in the instance variable. I believe you've already figured this part out.

# Test that it works

my_car = Car(2016)
my_car.what_is_the_price()
my_car.get_owner()

A:

You're not actually using self.year in your def what_is_the_price method.  You need to use the self.year variable instead.  When you call my_car.what_is_the_price() in your main loop, self.year = self.year + 1 will not increase the value of my_car.year (the local variable), so when it calls the method, self.year won't be a number.
def what_is_the_price(self):
    self.year = self.year + 1 #  Set the year on the object to the incremented value
    print(self.year)

You probably want to have the owner be another object.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and esophageal varices (EV) and gastroesophageal varices (GOV) are both a well-recognized complication of liver cirrhosis (LC). We investigated whether there is a relationship between CKD and the likelihood of EV and GOV in LC patients. We retrospectively analyzed the relationship between EV, GOV and the presence of CKD using a database of 420 LC patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy from 2005 to 2015 at our institution.

#print the car object
#print(c)

listcars.append(c)
listyears.append(c)

#listcars[0] = 'black'
#listyears[0] = 2009

listcars[0].color = 'blue'
listyears[0].year = 2011

#c = Car(['blue'])

This is my homework assignment:
So the next step in my thinking is, how can I now change the list that I created so that the car object is updated but still works with the integer if I change listcars? I'm really confused on how I can change it but still use the same int variable as a key to the object in the list...

A:

You can use set:
for key in listcars:

        self.weight = Weight(self.owner.mpg, self.mpg)

    def get_weight(self):
        return self.weight

(Note: my_car is a silly name, and could just as easily be car, if not the same thing)
The idea here is that the play_sound function will look up which sound is associated with a particular class of car by comparing its reg attribute to whatever reg was passed in the main function.  However, we can't just pass the Car object reg as an argument, because we want the function to work for any class, not just Car.
I tried simply defining play_sound as follows, but it's not quite what I want.
def play_sound(car_class):
    reg = car_class.reg
    sound = "click"
    play_sound(car_class, reg, sound)

But I keep getting this error:

How do I create a dictionary for this class? It should look like this when I print it out:
  {

           'mileage': 105,
            'type': 'luxury'
        },
        'Model 2': {
            'year_built': 1990,
           'mileage': 50,
            'type':'standard'
        }
    }

A:

What you are looking for is called a mapping or dictionary. There are a couple of built-in ones:
In [1]: mydict = {}

In [2]: mydict.update({'Model 1': {'year_built': 2000,'mileage': 105, 'type': 'luxury'}})

In [3]: mydict.update({'Model 2': {'year_built': 1990,'mileage': 50, 'type':'standard'}})

In [4]: mydict
Out[4]: {'Model 1': {'mileage': 105, 'year_built': 2000, 'type': 'luxury'}, 'Model 2': {'mileage': 50, 'year_built': 1990, 'type':'standard'}}

And if you want to format that in your way, it's straightforward with this:
In [5]: for k,v in mydict.items():
  ....:     print("{}{}={}".format(k,v,mydict[k]))
  ....:

    def __init__(self, brand, type, trim):
        self.brand = brand
        self.type = type
        self.trim = trim

Now if you're sure your brand and type will always be correct, you could initialize your Car object like this:
def init_car(brand, type, trim):
    if type == "trulli":
        # initialize your car object

But if the brand can be None, for example, and you don't want to throw an error, you should instead do this:
def init_car(brand, type, trim):
    # initialize your car object if brand is not None

Now your code would look like this:
def init_car(brand, type, trim):
    if brand is not None:
        # initialize your car object

This way, your error will go away, since when brand is None, that means that type will be None and you won't be able to create an object of type Car.
Also, you can use itertools.product to make a list with all combinations of your parameters:
for brand, type, trim in product(['trulli', 'bentley', 'gatior'], ['volvo', 'audi', 'fiat'], ['sport','sportback', 'turismo']):
    # now brand is 'trulli', type is 'volvo', trim is'sportback'

<|endoftext|>Selective lateralization of spatial working memory and an analog of the letter-position effect.
Spatial working memory for three locations was examined with digits, letters, and line drawings. In a second experiment, letter-position effects were examined in three conditions: letters in various locations, letters in a row, and letters in three locations. Performance with digits was similar to that with letters. Letter-position effects were absent in the letters in a row condition but not in the letters in various locations condition. This suggests that the effects are dependent upon a mechanism that compares letters in different locations, rather than a mechanism that processes their spatial locations in depth. The present results are most parsimoniously understood as an analog of the letter-position effect.<|endoftext|>Losing weight and being

STO window file to run in 14.04

Can anyone tell me where i can download a Windows Operating System image file that can be run as a live CD with the only interface being a single window?
I've downloaded and burnt an image but when i try to boot it with UBUNTU, it says that the file isnt a bootable image.
I'm using the CD/DVD program to burn the file to the disc.

A:

I've downloaded and burned an image but when i try to boot it with UBUNTU, it says that the file isnt a bootable image.

A bootable ISO image does not boot a computer if there's no BIOS on that computer. 
In other words, if there is no BIOS on your PC, you can't boot it (no matter what is on it). If you do, then it is a non-bootable CD/DVD.

<|endoftext|>Rotating roller bearing

A rotating roller bearing, or oblique roller bearing, is a form of rolling bearing that is mounted in an environment where it must resist both radial and axial loads.

Rotating roller bearings are commonly used in many types of machinery.  Axial loading is normally perpendicular to the shaft, where as radial loading is between parallel faces.

Two bearings are supported at each end by a bearing plate or frame, and between each end there are a number of axially spaced rollers, usually mounted on each side of the bearing ring by bearing bushings.

class Car:
    """A class used to represent a car"""

    def get_name(self):

        """Print the name of the vehicle to stdout"""

    def drive(self):
        """Drive the car a number of metres"""

    def park(self):
        """Park the car"""

We can then instantiate an instance of a car in Python:

.. code:: python

    # Instantiate a car
    my_car = Car()

    my_car.get_name()
    my_car.print_name()
    my_car.drive()
    my_car.park()

So, for example, we can drive a car for a certain distance before parking it, then print the name of the car, like this:

.. code:: python

    my_car.drive()
    my_car.park()
    print(my_car.get_name())

As you can see from the example above, the `my_car.get_name()` method is used to obtain the name of the car, `my_car.print_name()` is used to print the name of the car, and `my_car.drive()` is used to drive a distance before the car is parked.

We can also use the `my_car.drive()` method to drive the car to a certain destination, like this:

.. code:: python

    # Destination for car
    my_destination = 'Springfield'

    # Drive the car to the destination
    my_car.drive()

And here is what the code above would output:

.. code:: python

    # Car has travelled to Springfield

    my_car.get_name()
    my_car.print_name()

You can see the output of this example by running the code snippet below:

.. code:: python

    my_car.drive()
    print(my_car.get_name())
====================
class Car:
    """A class used to represent a car"""
    def drive(self):
        print('I can drive')

#### Running the Program

To run this program, you will need to create a new file called _car.py_ and add the following code to it:

    car1 = Car()
    car1.drive()

Then, you will need to run the program as follows:

    $ python car.py

Once you do this, you should get a line of output like this:

    I can drive

Now that you have the car program up and running, you'll see that we need to make two changes to our program. First, we need to define a method called _drive_ to allow the car class to do the same thing as the function, and we will also need to remove the print statement inside the method. To do this, add the following code to the _car.py_ file:

    def _drive_():
        print('I can drive')

Now, let's see how to call this method. We will first have to change the way that we called _drive_ ; the reason for this is that we will have to use an instance of our class.

### Note

We will return to the differences between methods and functions in more detail in Chapter 8, but essentially a method is a function that operates on an object.

To make this change, add the following code to the _car.py_ file:

    def drive(self):
        print('I can drive')
        self._drive_()

When you run the program with the changes you made, you should see something similar to this:

    $ python car.py
    I can drive

### Working with object-oriented programming

The code we just wrote created an instance of a car class called _car1_. To create another instance of the car class, add the following line of code to the _car.py_ file:

    car2 = Car()

Now, let's print the contents of car1.

    $ python car.py
    car1

We can print a lot of information about an instance of a class using the `dir
====================
class Car:
    """A class used to represent a car"""

    def __init__(self,make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

p1 = Car('Toyota', 'Prius', 1999)
p2 = Car('Honda', 'Civic', 2000)
p3 = Car('Tesla', 'Model S', 2018)

print(p1.make)  # Prints "Toyota"
print(p2.make)  # Prints "Honda"
print(p3.make)  # Prints "Tesla"

However, if you wanted to have a separate list of cars for each make, you could use a dictionary to store the data, and the make as the key. I am guessing that this is what you are asking about:
cars = {
    'Toyota': [Car('Prius', 1999), Car('Camry', 2013)],
    'Honda': [Car('Accord', 1999), Car('Civic', 2014)],
    'Tesla': [Car('Model S', 2018)]
}

make = input("Make: ")

for make in cars:
    print(f"{make}:")
    for model, year in cars[make]:
        print(f"{model} {year}")

print("Done")

Notice how I removed self (the car) from all variables in the car class.

because now it's completely overriden by the body of your function.
When a method overrides a parent's method, the return value is preserved in the original method. If you print the value, it's not the value returned by the method but the value in the original function, which in this case is None.
Moreover you shouldn't really need main() because all you want to do is print what you returned, not to actually print anything.

The above works perfectly. However, I am required to convert this to an object-oriented form. The following is my attempt. The main part of the file will remain unchanged, and I am just trying to create new objects with the
====================
class Car:
    """A class used to represent a car"""
    model = "Bugatti"
    year = 1995
    engine = "Veyron 16.4L"

def best_selling_model():
    """Returns the name of the best selling model of the year"""
    # The use of the map function instead of the str.format 
    # makes it possible to avoid unnecessary quotes 
    # and combine the use of str.format and map
    return "Best-selling car models for the year {0}:".format(
        str.format(Car.model.format(1995))
        + ", " + Car.year)

An then here is how I use it:
from Car import Car
from common import best_selling_model

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Code that could run outside of Python
    print(best_selling_model())

Which prints:
Best-selling car models for the year 1995:
    Veyron 16.4L

A:

The problem is that the variables in the method are never local to the method, so as soon as it's called, the values are replaced.  Instead of using locals(), you should use normal names:
def best_selling_model(self):
    # Here, `self` refers to the class, which means the `model`,
    # `year` and `engine` values are constant members.
    return "Best-selling car models for the year {0}:".format(
        self.model.format(1995)) + ", " + self.year

That said, I think there's some argument against storing data like this in the class itself.  In this case, it seems to me that you should just pass it as an argument to your method.
def best_selling_model(self, year):
    # The use of the map function instead of the str.format 
    # makes it possible to avoid unnecessary quotes 
    # and combine the use of str.format and map
    return "Best-selling car models for the year {0}:".format(
    
====================
class Car:
    """A class used to represent a car"""
    def __init__(self, model, color):
        """Initialize the car object"""
        self.model = model
        self.color = color

The "model" and "color" can be replaced by any of the attributes you'd like to keep for later. In this case, it's using integers as a key to each car model/color combination. This approach is nice if you have a dataset of thousands of cars, but the bottleneck may be your RAM/CPU.

<|endoftext|>The number of police officers in the armed forces, which is shrinking, is projected to dip below the current level of 9,175 by 2021 as a result of cuts, Minister of State for the Defence Airey Neave has said.

Mr Neave revealed figures showing that 9,176 armed forces personnel were in uniform on 1 September 2014, which will rise to 9,300 by 1 March 2016.

The official and permanent under secretary of state for defence (Permanent Under Secretary of State, Department of Defence, 2007-2015) has outlined the annual defence budget at an event attended by senior army officers.

He said there was a plan in place to reduce the overall strength in the armed forces in 2016, which should put the number at a "stabilising level".

The numbers also suggest that there will be an annual 1 per cent reduction from 2017 onwards, he said.

"We have not yet reduced the numbers, but in 2016 it is planned that it will be at a 1 per cent reduction per year," Mr Neave said.

"This will put the numbers in the armed forces at a level that will provide a more sustainable force which will be able to deal with emerging threats and future threats."

In response to the figures, the Ulster Unionist MP also said it was planned to have 100 more ambulances, and 10 more fire engines in Northern Ireland.

"But we're looking to cut back on the numbers of coast guard vessels that will be available because we've got to raise more money for new equipment, which we're doing, and it takes a lot of money to keep a guard boat," Mr Neave said.

"The one reduction I'd be very happy with is the reduction of numbers of officers because that's what we're planning to do."

Mr Neave's comments came in the wake of
