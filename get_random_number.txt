<|endoftext|>SA may have set a precedent that the PSA will not use torture. Last year, Amnesty International received correspondence from the Public Security Administration of Guandong Province (PSAG) regarding the case of Liu Xia, a human rights defender who had been a personal friend of one of the SAC’s founders, Zhang Qingli. According to the correspondence, Ms. Liu Xia had been held for more than 20 months in solitary confinement in a Chinese prison, on the basis of an “incriminating confession” she allegedly gave. The confession, in fact, was made as a result of torture, to which Ms. Liu Xia had been subjected. The correspondence further noted that the confession had been made under extremely harsh conditions, including high levels of noise and a complete lack of human contact. It also quoted a torture victim, who described being slapped with an electric baton in a Beijing prison, and being beaten with truncheons until he lost consciousness. Amnesty International is seeking legal action against SAC and the PSAG.<|endoftext|>Electrophysiology-guided ablation of ventricular tachycardia originating from the right side of the interventricular septum.
We present an unusual case of ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating from the right side of the interventricular septum which was electrophysiology (EP) guided. A 53-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy presented with short runs of monomorphic VT and was refractory to antiarrhythmic medications. EP-guided radiofrequency ablation was performed at the right ventricular endocardium between the free wall of the tricuspid valve and the coronary sinus. The earliest electrogram obtained from the low right ventricular septum was successfully eliminated. Post-ablation VT was no longer observed, and the patient remains free of ventricular arrhythmias with no antiarrhythmic medications for 2 years.<|endoftext|>Best Tablets Available in India

<|endoftext|>Q:

Should I encrypt the message in AES mode or use cipher directly?

I am not sure if it is an appropriate question, but I don't know why I ask it.
If I want to encrypt messages, I can use AES mode, I know it is more secure than ECB mode, but is it more secure than use cipher directly without any mode of operation?
Also can I encrypt different message with the same key, I can encrypt different messages with the same key in ECB, but it may create some messages that will not be encrypted? 

A:

As the comments have correctly pointed out: There is no secure symmetric-key encryption scheme that can encrypt arbitrary messages.
If you use AES in ECB mode or, in more modern symmetric-key cryptosystems, AES-GCM mode, the message must be padded (preferably with an arbitrary padding scheme, such as PKCS#7 padding, that allows you to distinguish arbitrary padding (like all padding schemes that have an explicit message size in bytes) from random padding, which often occurs during padding-free encryption, to make it explicit that no padding was used.
You mention that you're encrypting for confidentiality purposes: If so, it's entirely unnecessary to use an "authenticated encryption mode". In most modern cryptosystems, you should use

A:

One big issue you have is that you have a list comprehension inside a function (get_sample), which means the function is only ever called once. It is much easier to use a generator comprehension, i.e. [get_random_number() for x in get_random_number()]  instead of [get_random_number() for i in range(L)].

Tokyo - January 16, 2019: A photo shows a train and a car involved in a collision at the Sakurano Hachikō exit of Tokyo's Higashi-Nippori Station. (Photo: RuraidoShine/Pixabay)

A 29-year-old man driving a car was killed after colliding with a train at the exit of Higashi-Nippori Station in Tokyo today. The incident was recorded on a nearby security camera.

In the footage, the train is seen running through the station's main exit and the front of the vehicle is smashed into a bend of the railway line at the Sakurano Hachikō exit. The car's driver can be seen bleeding from the head.

The train was on its way to Tokyo Shinkansen Station at the time of the collision, according to TV Asahi.

The man was transported to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.

A:

As discussed in the comments you should use random.choice(list) method.
If your variable is 1 based then just do:
number = random.choice(1, 9)

If you have your variable 0 based you need to add 1 to the variable before using it in the function. 
def get_random_number():
    number = random.choice([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
    return number + 1

Also as a last note try to avoid global variables.

That's not exactly a simple solution, but it works. I would much rather be using a library that does this for you. As you can see, I've tried to keep it relatively simple and clean.

University of Salford student group election aftermath

By Josh LordPosted on 13.12.16

With the end of term fast approaching, there’s only one thing on most students’ minds: the undergraduate elective elections.

Once voted on, students can’t come too prepared when it comes to showing their support for a candidate.

As a result, it can be easy to underestimate which groups actually support a candidate, which often leads to dismay after results are announced.

In the process, though, candidates can learn more about the groups and the individual members than ever before.

Clinical history, audiometric examination, otorhinolaryngological examination, sonographic studies of the temporal bones, and a videofluoroscopic examination of swallowing. Tonsillar hypertrophy associated with enuresis and partial obstruction of the upper urinary tract with signs of permanent external compression. Anterior and lateral digital radiographs were important in the final differential diagnosis between tonsillar cyst and tonsillar hypertrophy. Sonographic studies of the temporal bones demonstrated no evidence of abnormal changes in the tympanic membrane. A videofluoroscopic examination of swallowing was highly suggestive of tonsillar hypertrophy as a cause of the clinical symptoms.<|endoftext|>/*

Guyford Greenhouse is a family-owned retail store specializing in cut-flowers and botanical materials, located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. It is the oldest botanical shop in Michigan and the only botanical greenhouse in the state. The Greenhouse is the former North Star Nursery, and was the first store in the United States to sell winter hardy plants. Guyford Greenhouse also has a collection of "orphan" orchids that are approximately 300 years old.

Background
The  store was opened in 1890 by George Guyford. The nursery closed for a few years during the Great Depression, reopening with as much plant material as they could secure for the market. During World War II the business was dormant, then was reopened by Guy's son Howard. In 1972 the nursery was purchased by Percy Turner and Henry Loznak, who renamed the business Guyford Greenhouse. Percy Turner's son Bob later ran the store until his retirement in 1988.

The store is famous for its orchids and dahlias. The store is open to the public every day, except for Mondays, when it closes at 4:00 p.m.

Awards and recognition
Guyford Greenhouse has been nationally recognized in multiple publications. 

The store was awarded the prestigious Home Gardening Editor's Choice award in the 2008 Dried Flower and Container Awards.

Of course you can and should repeat the call of random.seed to make sure the answer is always the same.
However, if you are writing a method to generate a random number of n.length elements then your best bet is not to rely on the current random generator in your system. Instead, use a RandomPool. That way you get a valid seed, it will produce a valid n.length sequence of elements and that same sequence will always be produced in the same run of the method.
import random
import itertools
import random
import collections

# This is the pool of random values that will be produced.
# This pool is started with an empty state.
# When the pool is exhausted it's rolled back to its start
# state.

def gen_randnums(n):
    # the pool of random numbers to generate.
    random_pool = random.RandomPool()
    # generate random values from the pool.
    return [random_pool.choice(i) for i in itertools.chain.from_iterable(random_pool.get())][:n]

def random_sequence(n):
    # generate the first n of the random sequence.
    # return a list of random values.
    return [gen_randnums(n) for _ in range(n)]

This has the added benefit that the results will be more repeatable and reproducible.
def random_sequence_2(n):
    # generate the first n of the random sequence.
    # returns a sequence of tuples of the values from the pool.
    return [(i, random.choice(random_pool.get()) for i in range(n)) for _ in range(n)]

Both of these return an immutable sequence, of tuples of random values from the pool.

    # generate the first n of the random sequence.

Calculate_payout(rng)
If it is guaranteed that a number generated by rng is only ever going to be a positive number, then the following code works just fine. It generates a random number between 1 and 100.

But if I remove this constraint and force it to be between 0 and 255, the numbers don't work correctly. It can be as little as -1 or as much as 256, and is rarely close to a reasonable value. Here is a log of running through the seed numbers 1000 times:

A:

Your for loop is iterating over every element in the returned array:
for number, time in random_number_generator:

and number is simply the first element in your tuple.
You probably want
for number, time, offset in random_number_generator:
    # do stuff

or
for number, time in random_number_generator:
    offset = time - number
    # do stuff

Also note that this code is testing if time is equal to one (or greater than one, which is likely an error) instead of checking if the time between two elements is less than the time between two elements.  Try something like
if time!= "1000":
    #...

This will make sure it only looks at elements where time_offset is 1000 and time_offset+count is greater than 10000.  Also note that time_offset and time_offset+count should probably be passed into GetResponse() rather than hard-coded as I have here.
As a final note, time.time() returns an integer (milliseconds) but you are using it as a float.  Also, it seems as though you would be adding the time.time() value as the time_offset parameter so you could just write
def GetResponse(offset):
    return offset + 1

<|endoftext|>The present invention relates to an imaging lens. In particular, the present invention relates to a small sized imaging lens applicable to a compact imaging device mounted on a portable phone, a PDA, a digital still camera, a tablet, or a smart phone and having a relatively long back focal length.
Along with the widespread of the mobile phones and the equipments such as PDAs, tablet PCs and smart phones, the demand for the imaging lens for mounting thereon has increased gradually, the imaging lens is required to be small sized, moderate in cost and have a sufficiently large aperture.
Referring to FIG. 1, a schematic view of a conventional imaging lens 1 is illustrated. The conventional imaging lens 1 includes an aperture 7, a first lens group 2, a second lens group 3, a third lens group 4, a fourth lens group 5, and a fifth lens group 6. In addition, the first lens group 2 includes a first lens 10, and the second lens group 3 includes a second lens 12 and a third lens 14. Moreover, the fourth lens group 5 includes a fourth lens 16 and a fifth lens 18. Furthermore, the fifth lens group 6 includes a sixth lens 20.
Accordingly, the conventional imaging lens 1 has a total track length of 18˜19 mm, and a length of 12˜13 mm of the fourth lens group 5, and a length of 18˜19 mm of the overall imaging lens 1 is equivalent to a length of 11˜12 mm of the first lens group 2 and a length of 10˜11 mm of the second lens group 3. Since the tracking capability of the fourth lens group 5 is insufficient, the fourth lens group 5 cannot be easily moved with respect to the second lens group 3, and the length of the first lens group 2 needs to be longer to increase the total length of the imaging lens 1. Accordingly, the length of the first lens group 2 of the imaging lens 1 is required to be shortened to achieve miniaturization of the imaging lens 1. However, when the length of the first lens group 2 is shortened, it is difficult to achieve an object to meet the low price requirement.
Therefore, how to design an imaging lens having a smaller size and a relative long back focal length is a important issue.<|endoftext|>“Leading Anti-Lynching March” Call for Unity, Awareness

Is it okay to use this? Should I be using something other than random.randint?
What is the difference between using.randint and.random.randint? I believe.randint uses/defaults to the.random random generator.
Should this be here instead?
What is the proper way of generating random numbers for a programming assignment?

A:

While the random.randint is safe, to make sure you're following all the pythonic rules, it's generally preferable to use random.choice:
random_number = random.choice([1, 2, 3])

If it's really important that you get a number in a specific range (say, [1, 3]), you could use random.randrange:
random_number = random.randrange(1, 4)

There's little difference between random.randint and random.randrange, but the latter is generally a bit clearer.
random.choice is built into the random module and does not need to be imported; it will just be random_number = random.choice([1, 2, 3])
random.randint and random.randrange are functions from the random module; they must be imported in order to be used.

Coyote: To end, you want to tell us a little bit about the future of what we’re doing and what your goals are for this movement, for this industry.

Wilkinson: The first thing I’d like to point out is that we don’t want people to think this industry is dying. We’re not, because the demand is there. I love saying it, because I think a lot of people forget. We’re on the farm bill because the demand for sustainable beef is there. We want to see this sustainable beef become more available.

I'm wondering which of the two has the guarantee to generate a number of 100. As far as I know, II doesn't guarantee that.

A:

Yes, both II and I will have this property.
The problem that you are facing is that neither of your two loops checks the value of rnd_num itself in the loop, so the only test that is being performed is whether the number generated is between 10 and 100.
If you want to guarantee that your random number will never be less than 100, you need to generate a number that's guaranteed to be between 10 and 99, and then use a loop to check whether the generated number is greater than 100, until the loop is successful.

A:

You are counting the previous answer as a correct answer.
The exception is that you ask for a number between 1 and 100 and not for a number that is between 0 and 100. The random module generate a number between 1 and 100 with
random.randint(0, 100)

But your question is about counting the answers, and what should you do? You can get more information about how much correct answers you have with count.

<|endoftext|>Iraq plans to unveil a special joint operation area (SOA) and headquarters in Baghdad in the coming days, to deter sectarian violence, Iraq's interior ministry said on Friday.

The new facilities will be part of a newly-announced security plan, the ministry said.

Baghdad will be divided into two regions: one to host Iraqis of the minority sects, the other for the majority, according to a ministry statement.

Such a plan could be the first of its kind in the region.

SOAs, or security zones, have been used in the past to protect different ethnic and religious groups, but such a system was not implemented across Iraq, and became unpopular.

The plan comes after Iraq's military spokesman said this week that security in the capital had reached a "dangerous level".

<|endoftext|>Chewing performance of chickens selected for body weight using graded intake feedstuffs.
Two experiments were conducted to compare the chewing performance of fast- and slow-growing chickens at 16, 28, and 50% of expected mature weight (22, 45, and 79 d). In Exp. 1, fast-growing chickens produced more weight and showed superior chewing performance than slow-growing chickens. Differences between genetic groups were not significant for chewing parameters, but a possible positive response of fast-growing birds to dry roughage at 16 and 28% expected mature weight would imply that the fast-growing strains would consume roughage when small. The difference in chewing performance was explained by the difference in growth rate, which was greater for fast-growing chickens than for slow-growing chickens. In Exp. 2, 8-wk-old fast-growing chickens were randomly assigned to one of two diets; 1) 100% roughage (R) or 2) 100% complete diet (C). The R and C groups were subdivided into two portions, which were fed for 4 wk at the same rate (weight gain of 40 g/d for R and 40 g/d for C) or at two different rates (weight gain of 100 and 40 g/d for R and C, respectively). No significant differences were found for growth rates, feed efficiency, or chewing performance between the 2 groups fed at 40 g/d for 4 wk and those fed at 100 g/d for the entire 8-wk study period. Fast-growing chickens have superior chewing

When you want to ensure that condition() doesn't execute twice, the simplest method is to return a value from condition() and check that it's not equal to None.
Here's a much more generalized way to make sure that two or more things don't happen simultaneously.
First, create a functools.partial object, which is basically an object that can act like a function. In this example, we'll use it to pass in our print statement so that it can be called later, after it's called. Here's the partial function:
import functools

def partial(func):
    """Passes the function as an argument to a new function"""
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(func(*args, **kwargs))
    return wrapper

Here's the complete function that uses the partial function to ensure that both print() statements are executed one after the other:
from random import randint
from functools import partial

user_input = get_random_number()
play_or_die = "Play"

print("Your game is currently paused.")

condition = partial(condition)

if user_input == play_or_die or play_or_die in user_input:
    condition()
    print("I'm glad you've chosen to play")
else:
    condition()
    print("You've made a bad choice")

print("It appears you don't want to continue")
user_input = get_input("Continue?")

if user_input!= play_or_die and play_or_die not in user_input:
    print("You've made a bad choice")

====================
def get_random_number():
    """Returns a number guaranteed to be random"""
    return random.randint(1, 100)

test = {
   'some_variable_name': 'this is what I wanted'
}

print(test['some_variable_name'])
print(get_random_number())
print(test['some_variable_name'])

A:

This is not a bug in python or the dictionary. Its because python saves only the final value.
Let's go step by step:
>>> test = {'some_variable_name': 'this is what I wanted'}
>>> print(test['some_variable_name'])
this is what I wanted
>>> print(test['some_variable_name'])
'this is what I wanted'

So you see the print didn't change the variable test.
Now let's change the dictionary with the print:
>>> print(test['some_variable_name'])
this is what I wanted
>>> test['some_variable_name'] = 'this is what I wanted (3)'
>>> print(test['some_variable_name'])
this is what I wanted (3)

So here we see that the print changed the variable test but did not print it.
Now let's go back to the first print:
>>> test = {'some_variable_name': 'this is what I wanted'}
>>> print(test['some_variable_name'])
this is what I wanted
>>> print(test['some_variable_name'])
'this is what I wanted'

We see that the second print has changed the variable and printed the dictionary test.

    r = random.random()
    return r

(Get_random_number and random)
With this, you can do a lot of things: 

Check if a value is between min and max
Generate a number between min and max (not sure how to do that if that's what you meant)
Print the result and show the modulo in an input box (i.e. 5-6 = 1)
Generate a list of random numbers
Generate a list of random numbers, store the result in a variable
Generate a list of random numbers, store the result in a variable, and do something to it
Print the result and show the modulo in an input box (i.e. 5-6 = 1)

You just have to be careful not to use the same number twice when saving it as a variable. Otherwise, you'll get one person's random list and another's. Also, be careful of using a function inside a function.

<|endoftext|>Infinite Flight

Infinite Flight is a novel by American writer Larry McMurtry.

It was a New York Times Notable Book of 1990.

Plot summary
The novel is an inside-baseball tale of small-town government, politics, and baseball.  Texas and Oklahoma are major areas for oil exploration, and the state of Oklahoma won two of the first three American League pennants.

Major characters
The book's fictional universe is based on McMurtry's boyhood in the Oklahoma-Texas borderlands.  It is centered on the sad and complicated relationship between Wyatt Dallas, a good-hearted and essentially useless catcher for a semi-professional ball team in the West Texas town of Irapuato (the port of origin for his great-grandfather at the end of the nineteenth century), and his wife, Lorena, who is a beautiful and highly emotional woman.  Lorena is related to Harry Truman, and to two governors of Texas—both with Theta Chi Theta Chi Beta Pi fraternity memberships.  A third governor, to whom Lorena is very close, is the President of the United States, and, being a strict Theta Chi, McMurtry has had a long professional relationship with the President.  As a result, McMurtry is in a position to know a great deal about national politics and national leaders.

# Main Program
main_loop()

A:

First of all, get_random_number() should not be a function of its own. It should be a global function of main_loop() which is called from it. The documentation says

If main is called as the main program, then the first argument should be a callable that will be called with None as its only argument.

So when the code is run as main, then you should pass in a function, i.e.
main_loop()

should become
main_loop(get_random_number)

Now the get_random_number() function does not return a string, it returns a random string. It looks like you're just using str(random.choice(...)) which will always return a string. If you want to get a random number, you have to random.randint() which will return an int.

<|endoftext|>A lot of action is expected as the Class of 2018 approaches their senior season. Here are a few players who could have an outstanding senior season.

Coach Todd Stroud has made it clear that he has a target on his back after going 11-13 his first two seasons and missing the postseason in 2017. With that in mind, the team is focused on doing two things this season:

1. Improve after last year

2. Senior day

The Tigers don’t have many underclassmen who will be able to produce for the Tigers in 2018.

Guard Michael Jones will likely be the top contributor. Defensively, the Tigers will be looking to improve on last year’s solid defense, which allowed only 15.8 points per game.

The most experienced team member on the roster will be post player Mike Hrycki. The 2019 Mr. Basketball Finalist averaged nearly nine points per game in his sophomore season, and could be more productive than last year if he’s allowed to develop his game and play through his mistakes.

There will also be questions about the level of experience on this year’s team.

Some key players that will be around for the Tigers to lean on in their second year at Stroud are the four starting guards — Michael Jones, Jared Hadden, Anthony Branch and Alex Wilkins.
