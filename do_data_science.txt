        return redirect(url_for('main_app.index'))

With render_template I am able to show the result of the function, but I don't know how I could go on to a different page that is a href.
I tried:
<a href="{{ url_for('main_app.data_science') }}">

But it doesn't work.

A:

You can return the url to be called directly, and after the redirect, change the href to the new url, like:
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, url_for, redirect

app = Flask(__name__)

def my_function(new_thing):
      return redirect(url_for('main_app.data_science', thing=new_thing))

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('home.html')

@app.route('/data_science')
def data_science():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        return render_template("home.html")
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        new_thing = request.form['submit']
        my_function(new_thing)
        return redirect(url_for('main_app.data_science', thing=new_thing))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

this way you will change the page with no problem

A rare case of cystic echinococcosis affecting the temporal bone with extensive infiltration of the facial bone is described. This echinococcosis was associated with a septicemia, the pathogenesis of which is discussed. The surgical management of this infection of the facial bone with a cyst of the temporal bone is reviewed. This is one of the two cases of cystic echinococcosis affecting the temporal bone, the other case being reported by Würtz and Fischer in 1993.<|endoftext|>Q:

How to ignore an error when parsing a string in Swift 3

I want to parse a string like [%uP%rP"C"%8%s{"name":"anurag"}%g] in Swift 3, it will return an error like "cannot assign value of type '[String]' to type 'String?'", now I just want to ignore the error, I do not want to check the type of result in Swift3.
When I typecast it as [String], there is an error: 

Value of type 'String' has no member 'componentsJoined(by:)'

This error tells me that string can not return [String], but I just want to ignore it, is there a solution?

A:

You're using an older way to build an array using string interpolation. This doesn't work in Swift 3, as it's deprecated. Instead, use conc

    stats = pd.read_csv('datasciencestats.csv', engine='python')

    # Find the row of the first cell

                    count.to_csv(input_file, header=False, index=False)

A:

It's because cell_id is a Series in your sample data, and if you call its.index() method, it gives you an index with no data (as you'd expect, since you are not actually using cell_id as a key), but its.values gives you a dataframe with a value for each key. You can instead do the following:
first_row = stats.groupby('cell_id')[0].agg('first')
with open('text_file.txt', 'w') as output:
    for cell_id, count in first_row.groupby(level=0):
        with open('datasciencestats.csv', 'r') as input_file:

Sting is a shoot-'em-up video game by King for the Super Famicom that was released in 1995. It stars Sting, an agent of Interpol who works for a secret agency called Element X. Players must defeat several different robots, each with their own special weapon and move set. The story is set in New York City, where Sting must defeat a series of master criminals.

Sting was heavily inspired by the early years of Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega's Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.

Story
Sting is an elite agent of Interpol. When his latest assignment comes in the form of a briefing with the heads of all the underworlds, Sting is instructed to go after a mysterious group called Element X.

I try to call this from terminal with
python do_data_science.py

when i try this i receive an error message that the module isnt found in library folder. 

A:

The quickest and most straightforward way is to import it from another.py file (or the top level script):
if __name__ == '__main__':
    do_data_science()

That way, your script can be used like:
python do_data_science.py

But of course, you can't import a function from another file in the same script.

If you want to save this for later, you can put the following line at the top of the script:
#import_modules()

Then:
import_modules()
do_data_science()

That way, the script's first statement is equivalent to calling the function.

But as others have mentioned, it's generally better to avoid this kind of globals.

If you really want to implement globals, you can modify your code like this:
globals().update(do_data_science())

<|endoftext|>ST. LOUIS – The San Antonio Spurs will start to celebrate their first championship in two decades Saturday when the 28-man NBA champion squad celebrates the momentous occasion on their own turf with a championship parade.

Mayor Clarence Harmon has announced that the evening festivities – where the game-worn green and white-emblazoned uniforms of the Spurs will be among the trophies on display – will start at 9 p.m. Saturday at Riverfront Plaza and head down Main Street to the Alamo. The city is expecting over half a million people to show up to show the Spurs their appreciation for an historic title.

The parade is expected to begin at City Hall, then head up Lamar Street to Commerce Street and then go over the river into Downtown San Antonio. Festivities will end at the old Alamo.

“I don’t think anyone is surprised that the Spurs are the only team to win three championships in the past 10 seasons,” said Lamar, who grew up watching the Spurs during their halcyon days under the coaching of Tom N

Dynamically add function to object

Trying to figure out if there is a good way to add a function to an object dynamically.
You would do something like:
//Setup an object with some stuff in it
var obj = { 
            someVar: 42,
            someOtherVar: 'what the hell'
            someOtherFunction: function() {
                    console.log("it's a function");
                }
            }

and then do a 
obj.addFunction(function(){
    console.log('hey')
});

My problem here is that addFunction only takes two arguments. If I want to dynamically add a function to it that is going to take a ton of arguments, what's the best way to do it?

    df.to_csv(DATA_FOLDER_PATH + 'CCI_data.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

A:

You could use glob to get the file names that match your pattern:
import glob
import pandas as pd

path = '/path/to/directory'
filenames = glob.glob('**/CCI_Summary.csv')

dfs = [pd.read_csv(path + filenames[i]) for i in range(len(filenames))]

df = pd.concat(dfs, ignore_index=True)

To get all the files use os.walk():
import os
import glob

path = '/path/to/directory'
filenames = glob.glob('**/CCI_Summary.csv')

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
    for file in files:
        file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
        df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

As a sidenote, you could use pd.ExcelFile and pd.read_excel():
import pandas as pd
import os

path = '/path/to/directory'

df = pd.ExcelFile(path + 'CCI_Summary.xlsx').parse(0)
df.to_csv(path + 'CCI_data.csv', index=False)

I am able to read the CSV file and then rename the columns as intended, but then I am stuck with how to pass data through the function to actually perform the calculations?

A:

First of all, there is no line with the name do_data_science, only the function do_data_science. So I assume you are looking for the function:

    """Does a data science"""
    df = pd.read_csv('data_science.csv')
    df = df.rename(columns = {'Var1' : 'col1', 'Var2' : 'col2'})

    model = linear_model.LinearRegression()
    print("Columns selected for X")
    model.fit(X, Y)
    return "RUNNING"

Now, you can call the function with:

<|endoftext|>A novel miRNA-based in vitro molecular mimicry approach.
Despite the increasing evidence of an antiviral role of miRNA and the success of early miRNA-based treatment approaches for specific miRNAs, a high variability of in vivo efficacy and potency as well as side effects remains unsolved. In order to provide a proof of principle that an in vitro miRNA mimic can cause viral inhibition, we established an in vitro DNA/RNA-driven molecular mimicry system and demonstrated its potency and mechanism of action. We provide the first example of a drug-like in vitro antiviral strategy that, by a short DNA oligonucleotide/RNA duplex, is capable of inhibiting the replication of diverse RNA and DNA viruses and is effective at nanomolar drug concentrations, which are 1 to 3 orders of magnitude less than what can be achieved by individual antisense oligonucleotides. Antiviral potency and cellular toxicity are comparable to viral inhibition by its antiviral RNAi counterpart. Molecular mimicry does not affect the cellular uptake and distribution of the mimics. The data show that a simple and economically priced in vitro chemical system is capable of mimicking the small but clinically relevant RNAi mechanism of action in a drug-like manner and may become a useful alternative to in vivo studies.<|endoftext|><?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>

How to give the permission to windows system account of hosting company in Django web application

My Django application will be deployed in hosting company.
When I tried to view the my application in the browser, it always shows an error.
Error:

'ASP.NET_SessionId' is not available for use in ASP.NET 4 applications.
  This can be temporarily disabled by adding '<configuration>' within the
 'system.web' section of your Web.config, and then restarting the

I searched this topic in Stackoverflow. It suggest to add the following line in the configuration file:
<system.web>
         <sessionState mode="Off" />
</system.web>

I have tried this suggestion but it didn't work for me. 
I don't know how to ask the hosting company to add the mentioned line in the configuration file.
Do anyone has any idea?
Thank you.

A:

It's not just one line. You need to add config like this in Web.Config:
<sessionState mode="Off" />

and probably also (if you use AuthenticationMode.Forms in your code):
<authentication mode="Forms">
    <forms name="MyApp" loginUrl="~/Login" timeout="1" />

<|endoftext|>Possibility of multiple sequence alignment using large set of cDNA clones.
Using a large set of expressed sequence tag (EST) clones it was possible to develop a theoretical method of similarity search for multiple alignment of DNA or protein sequences. The algorithm is based on the principle that the longer a cDNA sequence is, the less effective is it to choose any random location in the sequence. Thus, longer cDNA sequences can be considered to have greater probability to be expressed in their original state. It was found that the probability of detecting a given similarity

A 'callback' function is a function that returns a function.
A function in Python is defined as a 'closure' - a set of code that can be evaluated.  The closure contains the current state of the environment.
When you call the functino "do_data_science" you are passing the function object, which contains a reference to the environment of its execution.
When you pass a function as a parameter, that function will retain a reference to the environment it was created in.   This reference is typically a value in the parameters of the function, and is accessible using the variable that is usually referred to as self.

A:

The plus operator is not a concatenation but a string concatenation

With respect to Python, the plus sign is the addition operator, not
  the string concatenation operator.
The + sign is used as the default string concatenation operator when
  joining two or more strings. If you want to use the plus sign to
  indicate that you are doing string concatenation, use two separate
  operations: "foo" + "bar".

Source: http://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html
Hence you are getting a KeyError when you do this: 
X['col'+str(cell)] = cell

Change it to: 
X['col'+str(cell)] = cell.rstrip('0')

Another approach is to split the string and then use append to append the values. Something like this:
# create a list with the string
cells = cell.rstrip('0').split(' ')

# append the list of values
X['col'+str(cells)] = cells

A:

You're trying to concatenate cell which is a str type to another column col which is a number type. This obviously won't work.
The answer for this question would have been simpler and would've worked if you've just concatenated the cell with a space:
X['col'+' '+str(cell)] = cell.rstrip('0')

A:

As you can read here, matplotlib expects all dimensions to be in range [-1, 1]. It will crop the axes as needed, so it'll always look nicer.
You can try to use 
import matplotlib as mpl
mpl.rcParams.update({'fig.subplot.right': 0})

to change it to the default, you can also play with the xlim and ylim attributes of a subplot.

Rats were treated with D-sorbitol-8-C-levulinate monohydrate (Na-Levulinate) administered as a single daily oral dose of 200 mg/kg in the diet for a total period of 30 days. This treatment resulted in the inhibition of growth of the Walker 256 mammary carcinoma at a slow rate. After tumor excision, the regression of the lymph nodes was more complete than in untreated controls. These data may be of interest in respect of patients with breast cancer and other neoplastic diseases.<|endoftext|>Prospective outcome study of intraoperative assessment of left main coronary stenosis in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.
Pre-operative assessment of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing non-emergent on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is standard. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of coronary lesions < 30% assessed intraoperatively and to evaluate the impact on surgical management. Patients were scheduled for elective, elective CABG, and pre-operative risk stratification according to the EuroSCORE II was performed. During surgery, all three coronary artery ostia and segments with > or = 50% stenosis were assessed. These stenoses were considered significant, and further treatment (i.e., stent, additional distal anastomosis, or CABG) was performed. During 30 months, 635 patients with 431 isolated on-pump and 204 off-pump CABGs were enrolled. Of 805 grafts planned, 831 were performed (95% grafts to coronary arteries). Pre-

As we have covered more features, we introduce the ability to send a plain-text document containing "magic" bytes or in some cases, the original filename to the function that will result in some interesting insights. These two methods are handled by the `bin_write` and `read_text` methods of the `log` object that is passed to `main()`. Each file in this text format consists of a number of sentences. Our first function in this section extracts these words by leveraging the `word_tokenize()` function from the `gensim` package.

As we did in the previous chapter, we test our function for the ability to automatically recognize its input. The results, shown in Example 5-9, shows our ability to determine if the filename provided contains a magic character. This prevents the file from being downloaded if you don't have access to the file. If the file is there, it will save it to your hard disk.

##### Example 5-9. Extract magic words and render output of data science: magicsc.py

    def data_science(log, args):
        try:
            fname = args[0]
        except IndexError:
            print('Usage: magicsc <filename>')
            return -1

        if '!' in fname or '@' in fname:
            print("Failed to read file because magic bytes have been detected.")
            return -1
        else:
            #Read the file
            f = open(fname, 'rb')
            data = f.read()
            f.close()

            #Tokenize text
            log.writelines(word_tokenize(data))
